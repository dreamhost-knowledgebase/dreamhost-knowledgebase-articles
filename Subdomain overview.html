<p>In the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) hierarchy, a subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. A DNS hierarchy consists of the root-level domain at the top, underneath are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">top-level domains</a>, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain">second-level domains</a> and finally subdomains.</p>
<p>Valid subdomains as described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#Internet_standards">RFC</a> 1034 may contain any letter or number as well as the '-' (hyphen), but must begin with an alphabet character. While both upper and lower case characters are valid, subdomains are case insensitive so 'EXAMPLE.com' is identical to 'example.COM'.</p>

<dd><em>See also: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034">RFC1034</a></em></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can add as many subdomains as you like to any Top Level Domain.</p>
<h2><span id="Length">Length</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The length of a particular subdomain label is restricted to 63 characters</li>
<li>The number of subdomain labels in a domain name is limited to 127</li>
<li>The sum of the lengths of all labels must not exceed 255 characters.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Structure">Structure</span></h2>
<p>Subdomains are separated by dots "." and are read from left to right, in descending specificity. Each consecutive subdomain contains all previous subdomains, and is contained by any subsequent subdomains. All subdomains are contained by the second-level domain, which is in turn contained by its top level domain.</p>
<p>All the parts of a domain name, once joined together – the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">top-level domain</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain">second-level domain</a> and the subdomain – are called a <em>fully qualified domain name</em>. For example, 'example.com' is a fully qualified domain name; so is 'www.example.com' and 'my.really.long.fully.qualified.domain.example.com'.</p>
<h3><span id="Example">Example</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>yoursite.dreamhosters.com</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the top level domain is 'com'</li>
<li>the second level domain is 'dreamhosters', and</li>
<li>the subdomain is 'yoursite'.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Can_I_add_an_email_for_a_subdomain.3F">Can I add an email for a subdomain?</span></h2>
<p>Yes. Once the subdomain has been added to the 'Manage Domains' page, go to the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;">(Panel &gt; ‘Email’ &gt; ‘Manage Email’)</a> section of your panel proceed with the configuration steps detailed in the following article:</p>
