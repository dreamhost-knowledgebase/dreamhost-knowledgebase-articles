<h2><span id="Resolving_the_warning_message">Resolving the warning message</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are three methods to remove this error. Please keep in mind that the modification to fix this needs to be performed on the client side, so if you are getting this connecting from home/work you must update that specific computer.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span id="Method_One_.E2.80.94_Generate_a_new_host_key_.28MAC_or_Linux.29">Method One — Generate a new host key (MAC or Linux)</span></h3>
<p>If you have connected to a host in the past, the old host key is stored in your computer's <span class="text-object">/user/.ssh/known_hosts</span> file. If the key has been updated on the server, you must now delete the old key on your computer.</p>
<p>Run the following command in your shell.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Change <span class="code">HOSTNAME</span> to the host you're connecting to, such as <strong>example.com</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">ssh-keygen -R <span class="code-highlight">HOSTNAME</span></span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The <span class="code">-R</span> option removes the old key related to a specific hostname.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen">https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can now connect via SSH to store a new key.</p>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>When connecting this time, you'll see the warning&nbsp;<strong>The server's host key is unknown</strong>. This just means it's not in your <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file. You should confirm the fingerprint is what shows in the panel by using the instructions in the following article.</p>

</ul>
<p>Once you have confirmed they match you can log in and the key is automatically updated in your computer's <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file.</p>

<h3><span id="Method_Two_.E2.80.94_Deleting_your_known_hosts_file">Method Two — Deleting your known_hosts file</span></h3>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Do not use this method if you log in to servers other than DreamHost. If so, you’ll have no way of knowing if your SSH keys have changed since the <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file will have been deleted.</p>
</div>
<p>Delete your entire <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file (on your local computer) if you have several hosts that need to be updated.</p>
<p><strong>On a Mac or Linux machine</strong></p>
<p>The <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file is located in the <span class="text-object">.ssh/known_hosts</span> directory. You can simply run this command in a terminal to delete the <span class="text-object">known_host</span> file:</p>

<dd>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">rm .ssh/known_hosts</span>

<p>You must access the registry to remove the <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up ‘regedit.exe’ by doing a search.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="text-object">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\SshHostKeys</span></li>

<div class="alert-warning">
<p>This is an advanced method. Only use edit the <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> if you are comfortable <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH" target="_self">editing files via SSH</a>.</p>

<p>Edit the <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file. In the above case, open the file <span class="text-object">/home/username/.ssh/known_hosts</span> in the preferred text editor, and then remove the problem line. Make sure to change <span class="code">username</span> to your Shell user.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>This is similar to method two but rather than deleting the entire <span class="text-object">known_hosts</span> file, you delete the specific host line in the file instead.</p>
</div>
<p>The warning message lists the line number; it can be found after the file name in the error. In the above error message, the line number is 10,278. If you are on a Mac or Linux machine and if you are <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH" target="_self" rel="undefined">using the "vim" editor</a>, you can simply type the following command to jump to that line:</p>

<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">vim +10278 known_hosts</span></pre>
</div>

<dd>The editor opens to that specific line. Click the <span class="code">d</span> key twice to delete that line, and type a colon (<span class="code">:</span>) followed by the letter <span class="code">x</span>:</dd>
