<h2><span id="when_renew">When should I renew my certificate?</span></h2>
<p>Make sure you renew the certificate <strong>BEFORE</strong> the expiration date. This ensures you do not lose any protection.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you renew before the expiration date, you <strong>do not</strong> lose any time on your current certificate that you've already paid for.</p>
<h2>How to renew a certificate in the panel</h2>
<p>SSL certificates do not auto-renew by default. You must manually renew them within your panel.</p>
<p>Certificate Authorities typically send expiration/renewal reminders to the admin address anywhere from 30 to 90 days before the certificate’s expiration date. This is to let you know that you MUST take action to renew the SSL certificate. DreamHost sends SSL certificate renewal notices to the primary contact address of the account 35 days before the expiration date of the certificate. You can then manually initiate the renewal process in your panel.</p>
<p>There are three options to renew your Comodo signed SSL certificate, which are described in the following sections.</p>
<h3><span id="purchase_panel">Option one: Purchasing a renewal</span></h3>
<p>Renewing your certificate in your panel is basically the same procedure as purchasing a new <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-">professionally-signed SSL certificate</a>. To further help the renewal process, your current SSL certificate is:</p>
<ul>
<li>already recognized by the DreamHost system as expiring soon and processes a renewal order for you.</li>
<li>automatically renewed and installed to your panel after the order is approved.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="renew_panel">Option two: Renewing your certificate in the panel (before it's expired)</span></h3>
<p>To renew a Comodo certificate (before it's expired) by clicking the Renew button in the panel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Secure Hosting'</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><em>The Comodo Verified SSL setting appears on the right side of your domain, showing the expiration date and a 'Renew' link:</em></dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the 'Renew' link.

</li>
<li>Confirm your information, including your name, email, and address.

<div class="alert-content">
<p><strong>Confirmation address</strong></p>
<p>This must be an email on your domain. In the example above, the website 'dreamhost.com' is purchasing an SSL and using the address 'admin@dreamhost.com' to receive the email.</p>
<p>Make sure one of the emails listed in that dropdown has been created on your domain and you are able to receive mail with it. If it does not exist, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217139407-Email-quickstart-guide">create this email first</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify. So it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h3><span id="renew_panel_expired">Option three: Renewing your certificate in the panel (after it's expired)</span></h3>

<dd><em>A success message appears confirming the SSL certificate was renewed.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An email is sent to you that includes further information once the system has updated the certificate.</p>
<h3><span id="does_not_complete">What if my Comodo SSL certificate does not complete the renewal process?</span></h3>
<p>There may be situations when your renewal does not complete, even though you renewed your Comodo certificate in the panel. Typically this shows as 'Unknown' for the Expires value, which is usually due to a failure to respond to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-#dcv_confirm_email">request email</a> sent to the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order.</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> respond to the email that is sent in order to successfully complete the renewal of the certificate.</p>
<p>If you did not receive the DCV email to confirm your SSL certificate order, then follow these steps to reissue a new email request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Secure Hosting'</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button to the right of the domain.</li>
<li>When the Settings page opens, click the <strong>Resend DCV</strong> button.</li>
<li>Be sure to use a valid email address to send the order confirmation to.
<dl>
<dd><em>The DCV email is sent to the address you specified. Check your email, and then respond to the request. After the DCV email is confirmed, it can take up to an hour for the SSL certificate to become active.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="another_ca">Renewing your certificate with another Certificate Authority</span></h2>
<p>If you wish to renew the certificate with another Certificate Authority (CA), you can simply copy the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that's currently in your panel and use it to initiate the renewal process with them. You can access your CSR by following the instructions described in the following article:</p>
