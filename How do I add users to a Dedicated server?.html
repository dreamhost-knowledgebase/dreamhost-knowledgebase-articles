<h2>Adding a Shell user</h2>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Enabling-Shell-access">Enabling Shell Access</a> article for instructions on adding a normal Shell user to your Dedicated server.</p>
<p>The Shell user is able to run basic Shell commands after logging into the server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_an_admin_user">Adding an admin user</span></h2>
<p>The normal Shell user cannot run sudo/root commands on the server.</p>
<p>If you need to run sudo/root commands, you must create an admin user. This can be created on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dedicated.adminusers&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Admin Users</a> page.</p>
<h2>Important note about custom Admin user changes</h2>
<p>With an admin user, you can make root/sudo changes to your server, but please note that your Dedicated server is still managed by DreamHost. This means that if you make any custom changes to Apache, they will be overwritten whenever an Apache config is run. This can happen when adding hosting to a domain, or adding an SSL certificate. </p>
<p>If you make any custom changes, make sure to clearly note what they were so you can quickly fix anything that was overwritten.</p>
