<h2><span id="What_are_internationalized_domain_names_.28IDNs.29.3F">What are internationalized domain names (IDNs)?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are domain names that contain characters other than unaccented Roman letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the hyphen. For instance, <strong>日本語.idn.icann.org</strong> contains Japanese characters.</p>
<p>IDNs refer to the text <strong>before</strong> the '.COM', or '.ORG' part of the domain. The part <strong>after</strong>&nbsp;the name (.COM, .ORG, etc.) is called a TLD (Top Level Domain).</p>
</div>
<h2>Country specific TLDs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A&nbsp;TLD (Top Level Domain) is the part of the domain after your specific name such as .COM or .ORG. Generic TLDs include .COM, .ORG, and .NET and are not specific to any country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A country specific TLD would be used for a single country. For example, .DE (Germany) or .CA (Canada). You can view a full list at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers a wide variety of domain names including country specific TLDs which you can see in the panel at <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Registrations</a>. When the <span class="panel-page">Manage Registrations</span> page opens, click the <span class="text-link">See full pricing</span> link.</p>

<h2><span id="IDN_TLDs">International TLDs</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>International TLDs are different from country specific TLDs in that they use&nbsp;characters other than unaccented Roman letters (A-Z), digits (0-9), and the hyphen.</p>
<p>DreamHost does not currently support the registration of IDN TLDs. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>.xn--55qx5d (.网络)</li>
<li>.xn--io0a7i (.公司)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not currently a component of the <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> DNS root and thus are not available to all Internet users. View the following Wikipedia page for a full list:</p>

<h2><span id="Registering_and_hosting_your_IDN">Registering and hosting your IDN</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It is currently not possible to register an Internationalized domain name at DreamHost. However, you can still host it at DreamHost after purchasing it from another company that supports IDNs.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Registering_and_hosting_your_IDN">Hosting your IDN</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you've already purchased your IDN at another registrar that supports IDNs, you can then host it within your DreamHost account.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you need to convert your domain into punycode. This example uses the IDN of&nbsp;测试假域名.com. Visit a site such as <a href="https://www.punycoder.com/">punycoder.com</a>&nbsp;to translate this into punycode.</li>
<li>This will output punycode such as 'xn--sxqv5g23dyr3a428a.com'.</li>
<li>In your panel, navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosted Domains</a> page.

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Keep in mind that most modern browsers display IDNs properly, but if your visitors are not using browsers that support IDNs, they may not be able to access your international domain name with their browser.</p>

<h2><span id="NSSET_ID">NSSET ID</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Some international registrars have changed the way they handle TLDs. The registrations no longer include reference to the nameservers themselves but instead they reference an <strong>NSSET ID</strong>. You must register a group of nameservers to get this ID, then you can use it when registering the domain. The advantage is claimed to be that you can edit NSSET (change the nameservers) and this is applied to all domains referencing the same NSSET.</p>
<p>The TLDS that are known to use this are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.cz</strong> (Czech Republic)</li>
</ul>
<p>The NSSET ID you must use is "DREAMHOST".</p>
