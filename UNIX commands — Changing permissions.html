<p>This article shows how to change file or directory permissions using SSH or FTP. For an overview of permissions, view the following article:</p>

<h2>Changing permissions via SSH</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're logged into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview" target="_self">SSH</a>, you can change permissions by running the <span class="code">chmod</span> command. There are two ways to set permissions using chmod.</p>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ul>
<li>Numeric Mode</li>
<li>Named Mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Numeric Mode is easier to understand as you just need to add up the values.</p>
<h3><span id="Numeric_Mode">Numeric Mode</span></h3>
<p>Using the numeric mode, you can assign numbers to each permission. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd>4 = r (read)</dd>
<dd>2 = w (write)</dd>
<dd>1 = x (execute)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then, you would add all three together for each owner to get the full value. The following table illustrates the different permissions each owner could possibly have.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>7</strong></td>
<td>read, write, and execute ("rwx")</td>
<td>4 + 2 + 1 = 7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>6</strong></td>
<td>read and write ("rw-")</td>
<td>4 + 2 = 6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>5</strong></td>
<td>read and execute ("r-x")</td>
<td>4 + 0 + 1 = 5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>4</strong></td>
<td>read only ("r--")</td>
<td>4 + 0 + 0 = 4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>3</strong></td>
<td>write and execute (rare) ("-wx")</td>
<td>0 + 2 + 1 = 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>2</strong></td>
<td>write only (rare) ("-w-")</td>
<td>0 + 2 + 0 = 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1</strong></td>
<td>execute only (rare) ("--x")</td>
<td>0 + 0 + 1 = 1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td>no permissions ("---")</td>
<td>0 + 0 + 0 = 0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Remember, there are three sets of owners of a file or directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>User</li>
<li>Group</li>
<li>Public</li>
</ul>
<p>All three have their own permissions. Thus, all three must now be added together to get the full value.</p>

<p>While the above commands regarding <span class="code">chmod</span> are useful, it can be understandable if a user doesn’t want to have to log in via SSH just to change permissions on a file. Fortunately, many FTP clients such as <a href="#filezilla" target="_self">FileZilla</a> have the ability to change permissions directly within the client.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span id="Named_Mode">Named Mode</span></h3>
<p>There are two sets of permissions to assign when using 'Named Mode', which are 'who' and 'what' permissions. For example:</p>
<p><strong>who permissions</strong></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>u</strong></td>
<td>change the user bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>g</strong></td>
<td>change the group bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>o</strong></td>
<td>change the other bits</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>a</strong></td>
<td>change the bits for everybody</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>what permissions</strong></p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>r</strong></td>
<td>grant read access</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>w</strong></td>
<td>grant write access</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>x</strong></td>
<td>grant execute access</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>s</strong></td>
<td>set the sticky bit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Using ("+") and ("-") with the information above, you’d combine permissions from the 'who' and 'what' groups to assign the exact permissions you desire.</p>
<h3><span id="Examples">Examples</span></h3>
<p>The format to use <span class="code">chmod</span> in the following commands is:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod "groups"+"access" file.example</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Allows everybody to read file.txt. In the following example, <span class="code">a</span> is the bit for 'everybody' and the <span class="code">r</span> (read) permission is added:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod a+r file.txt</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Strips everybody of all permissions, except for the owner who retains any former permissions. In the following example, <span class="code">g</span> is group bit, <span class="code">o</span> is the 'other users' bit and the <span class="code">-</span> sign is removing all permissions (rwx):</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod go-rwx file.txt</span></pre>
</div>
<p>The file named <span class="text-object">script.cgi</span> is now executable by the user and group. In the following example, <span class="code">u</span> is the user bit, <span class="code">g</span> is the 'group' bit, and the <span class="code">x</span> permission is added to both:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod ug+x script.cgi</span></pre>
</div>
<p>All files created in the directory <span class="text-object">somedir</span> are owned by the group that owns <span class="text-object">somedir</span>. In the following example, <span class="code">g</span> is the group bit and the <span class="code">s</span> flag is added to it:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod g+s somedir</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="Special_permissions">Special permissions</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Special permissions can be added which allow you the special ability to automatically change users or group, or to specify a directory as a "temporary" directory.</p>
<h3>The 's' flag</h3>
<p>An <span class="code">s</span> can be added to the owner or group 'read' permission. This indicates the setuid/setgid permission.</p>
<ul>
<li>If set on the group read permission, it sets the setgid bit. This means that any user who changes into that directory suddenly performs all actions as if the owners group was their default group. This can be helpful if you want all files in that directory to be created/owned by that owner group.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If set on the owners read permission, it sets the setuid bit. This is not usually a good idea, so don't do it unless you really know what you're doing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The 't' flag</h3>
<p>The <span class="code">t</span> flag is basically the same thing as the <span class="code">s</span> flag for a user or group, but is used when applied to all others. Here, the meaning is a little different. It means that anyone can create a file in the directory, but only the owner is allowed to remove the file, regardless of permissions set. This is the "temporary" directory permission and should also be avoided unless you really know what you're doing.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="filezilla">Changing permissions in an FTP client</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you right click on a file in an FTP client, you can view it's permissions. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/filezilla-permissions_01.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>As discussed above, this format uses the Numeric Mode to set permissions. You just need to add up the values to change them.</p>
<p>This example uses Filezilla. You can either click the checkboxes, or type in the Numeric value of the permissions you need to change.</p>
