<p>You cannot use a .dev or .app domain/subdomain on <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000760131-Getting-started-with-Remixer">Remixer Cloud Hosting</a> since they do not support HTTPS/SSL certificates. This applies to situations when you publish Remixer Cloud-hosted sites using the <strong>Publish</strong> button.</p>

<p>The following describes why HTTPS is forced by default on both .dev and .app domains.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HY1ER3S9FEMBTBV1B4GAC4D7">Why do .dev and .app domains force HTTPS by default?</h3>
<p>The .dev and .app domains are both owned by Google. As part of Google's initiative to secure <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003425491-Not-Secure-warning-in-Google-Chrome" target="_self">website connections</a>, .dev and .app domains force HTTPS by default.</p>
<p>Since HTTPS is forced at the registry level by Google, there is no way to override this redirect. The only option is to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview" target="_self">install an SSL certificate</a> to ensure your site does not throw a browser warning.</p>
