<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058">virtual private server</a> (VPS) uses roughly 100 MB of memory as a baseline without any user processes running. That's because several system processes must run for your VPS to work (sshd, proftpd, and so on). You must remember this when allocating memory for your VPS since that initial 100 MB is largely unusable for your site processes.</p>
<p>After that initial 100 MB, most of the memory used by your VPS consists of Apache and PHP processes (or, in the case of Rails applications, Passenger and Rails processes).</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Example_of_how_processes_use_memory">Example of how processes use memory</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Whenever someone views your website, the PHP file for the page they view is parsed and executed by a PHP CGI process. At the same time, an Apache process will need to run to serve the resulting HTML output from the script to the browser.</p>
<p>The number of these processes that run is proportional to the amount of traffic you have. For example, if you have a large influx of traffic, additional PHP and Apache processes will spawn to facilitate that traffic. Apache and PHP will continue to spawn processes as requested until your VPS is completely out of memory.</p>
<p>You must be careful how you set things up to prevent such problems. This often leads to problems where websites on a VPS will stop working due to memory saturation during peak hours and will start working normally again once the traffic dies down to more manageable levels.</p>

<h2><span id="Checking_your_memory_usage">Checking your memory usage</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can view your private server’s memory usage graph in your panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPS</a> page.</li>
<li>To the right of your VPS, click the <span class="text-object">RAM</span> graph icon under the <span class="text-object">Usage</span> column.

</li>
</ol>
<p>The memory usage graph on your web panel helps you see usage trends but doesn't help get a good picture of what's actually going on in real-time since these graphs are generally updated once a day around midnight PDT/PST and are an average of the day's use.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="The_top.2C_free.2C_and_ps_aux_commands">The top, free, and ps aux commands</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You'll need to SSH into your VPS to obtain more information on exactly what's going on.</p>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Open two connections in separate windows so you can easily review the results.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you're in, your primary tools are <span class="code">top -c</span>, <span class="code">free -m</span>, and <span class="code">ps aux</span>.</p>
<h3><span id="Using_the_top_command">Using the top command</span></h3>
<p>The <span class="code">top</span> command displays the currently active processes, the % of the CPU they're using, how much memory, which user is running it, and so on. Once <span class="code">top</span> is running, you can press <span class="code">Shift + m</span> to sort processes by memory usage rather than by CPU usage.</p>
<p>While examining your top output, knowing what information you need to look at is important. The memory allocation you set in your panel relates to physical memory being used (as opposed to virtual memory). That memory corresponds to the <span class="text-object">RES</span> column in <span class="code">top</span> output. Below is what <span class="code">top</span> output sorted by memory (<span class="code">Shift + m</span>) might look like (the actual processes will likely be different on your VPS):</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">PID   USER     PR NI   VIRT  RES SHR   S &nbsp;%CPU &nbsp;%MEM    TIME+   COMMAND

23618 exampleu  20   0  250m  13m 8256  S  4     1.3   0:00.19  php74.cgi
23684 exampleu  20   0  250m  12m 8256  S  7     1.3   0:00.10  php74.cgi

23654 exampleu  20   0  250m  15m 8252  S  6     1.3   0:00.17  php74.cgi
</pre>
</div>
<p>In the above example, you'll see a series of php74.cgi processes running which means the site spawning these processes is running under PHP 7.4. In the <span class="text-object">RES</span> column, you can see how much memory each is using. In this case, they all use 12–15 MB of memory. On a busy VPS, you'll likely have several Apache processes running. Those average around 9-11 MB of memory each. Apache and PHP processes multiply as your sites start serving more requests, so you can see that memory usage can quite easily skyrocket if you receive a lot of traffic.</p>
<h3><span id="Using_the_free_command">Using the free command</span></h3>
<p>In your other window, you can run <span class="code">free -m</span>. This command displays the current memory usage on your VPS and should look something like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1000         233         114          21         652         766
Swap:             0           0           0
</pre>
</div>
<p>The <span class="code">-m</span> option tells the command to display the memory usage in megabytes.</p>
<p><strong>total&nbsp;—&nbsp;</strong> In the above example, the total available memory is roughly 1GB. You can see this value as 1000MB under the <span class="text-object">total</span> column.</p>
<p><strong>used&nbsp;—&nbsp;</strong> Under the <span class="text-object">used</span> column in the first row, it shows 233 MB used.</p>
<p><strong>available&nbsp;—&nbsp;</strong> Under the <span class="text-object">available</span> column, it shows 766 MB available. This is the total memory available for starting new applications or processes.</p>
<p>The total you see should correspond to the amount of memory you allocated to your VPS in your panel.</p>

</ul>
<h3><span id="Using_the_ps_aux_command">Using the ps aux command</span></h3>
<p>The <span class="code">ps</span> command supplies you with similar information as <span class="code">top</span>, but simply takes a snapshot of the active processes and their usage and displays it on your screen. This is useful if you only want to see a particular process(es). For instance, if you only want to see running Apache processes, run the following command:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ps aux | grep apache</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>That will "pipe" (or pass) the output from ps to the <span class="code">grep</span> command, which will filter that output on a per-line basis looking for the string <span class="text-object">apache</span> in it. Any line with that output is displayed.</p>
<p>Another useful variation is:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ps aux | grep php</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This allows you to observe all the PHP processes that are running.</p>
</div>
<h2>Recovering from memory saturation</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Memory saturation is when your VPS is using up its entire allotment of memory. When this happens, a variety of things will start to happen. Your sites will likely stop responding in many cases, but beyond that other essential processes on your VPS will stop responding as well such as the SSH server, FTP server, streaming media server, and so. Your VPS can enter a state where you can't even log in due to memory saturation.</p>
</div>
<h3>Checking for the cause</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can usually tell if this is happening to you by checking a few things:</p>
<h4>Checking your resource graph in the panel</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214880128-How-to-check-your-resource-usage-on-a-VPS" target="_self">How to check your resource usage on a VPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the resource usage graph shows your memory spiking high above the allocated memory, then this is likely what's happening.</p>
<h4>Run the 'free' command'</h4>
<p>If you can still log into your VPS via SSH, try running the <span class="code">free -m</span> command to see how much memory you have available. The closer that is to zero, the worse you are. At zero, you've reached total memory saturation, and what happens next can be unpredictable.</p>
