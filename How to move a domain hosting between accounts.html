<p>DreamHost does not offer a service that automatically moves a domain hosting from one account to another. This means that if you need to move a domain and its files from your account to another account, you need to manually move the domain's contents. This process requires that you download and/or backup all of the domain's files, emails, database, etc., that you wish to move. If you also wish to move a domain registration, you must transfer the registration using the standard domain transfer process. DreamHost is only able to move your discussion and announcement lists.</p>
<h2><span id="First_step_for_NEW_account_owners">First step for NEW account owners</span></h2>
<p>If the domain you wish to move to your account is currently hosted on another DreamHost account, you must create a new account using a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284771-What-is-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-">dreamhosters.com subdomain</a>. For example, if the site (on the existing DreamHost account) you wish to move to your new account is named example.com, add example.dreamhosters.com as your domain name when originally signing up.</p>
<p>Once you've created a new account with this new dreamhosters.com subdomain, you can then proceed with the steps below to move the site to your new account.</p>
<h2><span id="Moving_Discussion.2FAnnouncement_Lists">Moving Discussion/Announcement Lists</span></h2>
<p>Because discussion and announcement lists require special attention, please contact support on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=support.msg">Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Contact Support'</a>) page before you begin the process. This way, DreamHost support can make arrangements to help you move them. As stated previously, DreamHost cannot help you move any other aspect of your account.</p>

<h2><span id="Restrictions">Restrictions</span></h2>
<p>You should be aware of a few restrictions that apply to internal domain migrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Receiving account cannot be using an active promotion, meaning that if the account is still within the first year of hosting and signed up using a promotional discount, it's not possible to add the domain.</li>
<li>The Receiving account cannot have a referrer (this also only applies if the account is within the initial year of service).</li>
</ul>
