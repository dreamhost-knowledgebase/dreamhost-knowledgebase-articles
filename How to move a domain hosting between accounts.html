<p>If you are having trouble moving your website between accounts, or just don't have the time, DreamHost currently offers a Content Move service that takes care of that for you. You can find more information in the DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027686731-Website-migration-services">Website migration services</a> article.</p>

<p>The steps below explain how to manually migrate your data. This only applies if you prefer to migrate the content of your site on your own (and not use the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027686731-Website-migration-services" target="_self">DreamHost migration service</a>).</p>

<h2><span id="new-account-owners">First step for NEW account owners</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If the domain you wish to move to your account is currently hosted on another DreamHost account, you must create a new account using a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284771-Using-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain">dreamhosters.com subdomain</a>. For example, if the site (on the existing DreamHost account) you wish to move to your new account is named <strong>example.com</strong>, add <strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong> as your domain name when originally signing up.</p>
<p>Once you've created a new account with this new <strong>dreamhosters.com</strong> subdomain, you can then proceed with the steps below to move the site to your new account.</p>

<h2><span id="restrictions">Restrictions</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You should be aware of a few restrictions that apply to internal domain migrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Receiving account cannot be using an active promotion, meaning that if the account is still within the first year of hosting and signed up using a promotional discount, it's not possible to add the domain.</li>
<li>The Receiving account cannot have a referrer (this also only applies if the account is within the initial year of service).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to move the hosting for a domain to a new account, you must first backup all necessary files. This includes web server files, databases, and email.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> delete the domain from your panel until you have backed up all data. This may permanently delete your data.</p>
</div>
<p>The following articles provide information on how to make a backup of each.</p>
<h3>Website files</h3>
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a>: This article explains how to connect to your DreamHost server using an FTP client. Once connected, you can then download all of your website files to your local computer. These files will then eventually be uploaded to the new account.</p>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215039758-How-do-I-backup-my-database-">Backing up MySQL</a>: This article explains how to backup your database (assuming you have one). Some simple websites may not use a database. If that’s the case with your website you can skip this step.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215730637-Back-up-email">Backing up emails</a>: If you have any email addresses hosted with DreamHost for the domain you’re moving, these must be backed up before you remove hosting. This article explains how to use an email client to connect to your address using the POP3 protocol. This allows you to download your email files to your computer.</p>
<h3>Full account backup</h3>

<h2><span id="step5">Step 5 — Moving your domain registration</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Some international domains cannot be transferred from account to account by the customer. In these cases, the receiving customer’s panel requests that they contact DreamHost support for further assistance.</p>

<p>Moving a domain registration between accounts is the same as if you were moving it to another registrar. For instructions on how to move the registration only, please visit the articles below:</p>

</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>It's not required to move the domain registration to the new account to enable hosting for the website. However, having both the hosting and registration on the same account makes it simpler to keep track of both.</p>
