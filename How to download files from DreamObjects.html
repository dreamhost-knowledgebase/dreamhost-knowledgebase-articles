<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are a wide variety of ways to download files from DreamObjects, mainly depending on your preferences, skills, and the permissions set on the objects.</p>
<p>DreamObjects supports basic permissions in the panel as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217590537-How-To-Use-DreamObjects-S3-compatible-API#authentication-s3">Access Control Lists (ACL)</a> compatible with Amazon S3 on buckets and objects. In the panel, permissions can be set as either Public or Private.</p>
<ul>
<li>Public buckets and objects can be accessed by anyone.</li>
<li>Private buckets and objects can only be accessed via a signed URL or through the API with the proper credentials.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01HTZRSFN2ETHHH3KFVF2HPVYK">Downloading a file with a signed URL</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The object can have PUBLIC or PRIVATE permissions set on it. If PRIVATE permissions are set, you can only download the file using a signed URL. This allows the object to be accessed regardless of its permissions.</p>
<p>Navigate to your object in the 'Object Viewer'. Click it to view the 'SHARE URL' address. Right-click the download link to copy a URL. By default, this link is valid for one hour.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HTZRSFN2FFRYN5AR37REXKXB">Downloading a file with PUBLIC permissions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can click the 'toggle' button to change the permissions to PUBLIC. You can also change permissions using a client such as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217131247#permissions">Cyberduck</a>.</p>

</dl>
<p>An object with PUBLIC read permissions may be downloaded through any web browser simply by browsing to its URL. For example, an object called ‘MY_OBJECT’ in the bucket called ‘MY_BUCKET’ can be downloaded by browsing to this URL:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/<span class="code-highlight">MY_BUCKET/MY_OBJECT</span></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="h_01HTZRSFN2WZBAZZAX6S8VCQ40">Downloading using a client</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The best option to download objects is by using a client. This allows you to download entire buckets and all objects within them. View the following section for a list of clients.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000059232-DreamObjects-clients">DreamObjects clients</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HTZRSFN2FNREB4F93YVHV6J8">Uploading limits</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Objects are limited to 10TBs, but must be uploaded in 5GB chunks. Please note, not all clients are able to do multipart uploads. For anything above 5GB, you must use a client that supports multi-part uploads.</p>
