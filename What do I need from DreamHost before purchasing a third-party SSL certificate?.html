<p>You can purchase a certificate directly from a Certificate Authority (CA) and install it in to your DreamHost panel. To do this, you’ll need a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) which can be found in your panel.</p>
<p>The following steps explain how to obtain this CSR in your panel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767487-How-do-I-add-a-free-self-signed-SSL-certificate-">Adding Secure Hosting</a> (self-signed certificate) article to add Secure Hosting and a self-signed certificate to your domain.</li>
<li>Go to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><em>The 'Manage Domains' page opens.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>To the right of your domain, click on the <strong>Certificate Active</strong> link.</li>
<li>When the 'Secure Hosting' page opens, click the 'Import SSL' radio button to expose the current certificate information.
<dl>
<dd><em>There are several large text fields on this page:</em></dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>COPY (do NOT cut) the text from the Certificate Signing Request field box.</li>
<li>Paste the text into the order form from whichever Certificate Authority you'd like to purchase your signed SSL certificate.</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>When purchasing a signed SSL certificate, you must specify the server type:</p>
<ul>
<li>To use the SSL certificate on DreamHost's servers, specify the server type as: <code>Apache 2.X w/MOD_SSL</code></li>
<li>Once you successfully complete your purchase, the CA sends you the signed SSL certificate; you can then replace the self-signed SSL certificate with this signed SSL certificate in your panel.</li>
