<p>An SSH client can be thought of as a program/application that allows you to run Shell commands. There are many different types of terminal clients you can choose, depending on your operating system. This article gives you an overview on some popular choices.</p>
<p>View the following article for a more information on different clients:</p>

<h2>Operating system clients</h2>
<h3>Max OS and Linux</h3>
<p>Mac OS and Linux operating systems already have built-in terminals you can use.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Windows is the only commonly-used operating system that does not include a native SSH client. Windows users need to download SSH software separately (see below). </p>

<h2><span id="Unix.2FLinux">Unix/Linux</span></h2>
<p>Most distributions of Unix/Linux come with the <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> package. Any terminal application (xterm, Konsole, and so on) can be used to initiate a secure shell.</p>
<p>To open your terminal, type in <span class="code">CTRL + ALT + T</span>. This should automatically open your terminal where you can start running commands. You could also search for the word 'terminal' in your distribution's dashboard. This varies depending on which distribution of Linux you're using.</p>

<h2><span id="Windows">Windows</span></h2>
<p>Every Windows SSH client has its own way to be installed and launched, but once you've set it up, there is no difference in further operations. However, each client is suited to specific (or general needs). So, you may wish to try more than one to see what works best for you. Here are a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>

<dt><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215464538-How-do-I-configure-PuTTY-">PuTTY</a></dt>
<dd>This is a free and very popular client for Windows users.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a></dt>
<dd>This is a free and popular client as well. However it’s not a fully functioning client compared to PuTTY.</dd>
