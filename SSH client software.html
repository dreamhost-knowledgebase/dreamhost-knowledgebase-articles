<p>Most distributions of Unix/Linux come with the <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> package. Any terminal application (xterm, Konsole, and so on) can be used to initiate a secure shell.</p>
<p>To open your terminal, type in&nbsp;<span class="code">CTRL + ALT + T</span>. This should automatically open your terminal where you can start running commands. You could also search for the word 'terminal' in your distribution's dashboard. This varies depending on which distribution of Linux you're using.</p>

However, each client is suited to specific (or general needs). So, you may wish to try more than one to see what works best for you. Here are a few options:</p>
