<p>Most distributions of Unix/Linux come with the <a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> package. Any terminal application (xterm, Konsole, and so on) can be used to initiate a secure shell.</p>
<p>To open your terminal, type in&nbsp;<span class="code">CTRL + ALT + T</span>. This should automatically open your terminal, where you can start running commands. You could also search for the word 'terminal' in your distribution's dashboard. This varies depending on which distribution of Linux you're using.</p>

<p>There are also third-party clients you can use with Windows. Every Windows SSH client has its own way to be installed and launched, but once you've set it up, there is no difference in further operations. However, each client is suited to specific (or general needs). So, you may wish to try more than one to see what works best for you. Here are a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215464538-Configure-PuTTY">PuTTY</a></dt>
<dd>This is a free and very popular client for Windows users.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a></dt>
<dd>This is a free and popular client as well. However, itâ€™s not a fully functioning client compared to PuTTY.</dd>
