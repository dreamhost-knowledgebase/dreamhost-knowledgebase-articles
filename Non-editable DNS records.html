<p>You’ll notice that there are numerous non-editable DNS records on your domain’s <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360053106191" target="_self">DNS</a> page.</p>

<p>If you need to modify the A record, "www", or "ftp" records for your domain, you will need to remove the web hosting from that domain. This is done by setting the domain to 'DNS Only'. View the following article for instructions on how to do this:</p>

</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you do not remove your hosting when adding your custom A records, a DNS conflict will occur as the domain will then point to two locations and will not respond properly.</p>

<p>When you remove the web hosting, it will take some time before the change is reflected in the DNS records.</p>
<p>You can force the refresh on your domain's edit page, but you can do so once every 12 hours.</p>
<p>A typical DNS change will take up to 6 hours to resolve. Changes to the nameservers, however, will take longer. This will often resolve within 3 to 72 hours.</p>
