<p>First, make sure the administrator email address is hosted at DreamHost. You can verify this by doing an MX record lookup on the following site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net">whatsmydns.net</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've confirmed your email is hosted with DreamHost, you can proceed with spoofing your FROM address in a useful manner.</p>
<h2><span id="Using_WordPress">Using WordPress</span></h2>
<p>Some WordPress contact forms created by plugins or themes have settings that let you completely control how emails are sent. <a href="http://contactform7.com/">Contact Form 7</a> is an example. You can use the plugin settings in the WordPress admin panel to send emails out with the name of the site visitor and an email address of a site admin, webmaster, or anyone associated with running the site:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>From: [your-name] &lt;admin@example.com&gt;</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can also configure the Reply-To header so that replies to these emails will go directly to the site visitor:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Reply-To: [your-name] &lt;[your-email]&gt;</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a separate <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/configure-smtp/">Configure SMTP</a> plugin you can use to set the From information on all emails sent from WordPress, regardless of the plugin or theme that sends the email.</p>
<p>Additional WordPress information can be reviewed at <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214831378-Troubleshooting-WordPress-contact-forms">WordPress troubleshooting contact forms</a>. Please note however that not all plugins and themes allow you to control this.</p>
<h2><span id="Using_Drupal">Using Drupal</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/contact_reply_to">Contact Reply-To</a> module changes Drupal's contact form to send from the website's email address. It also sets a reply-to header to the actual user, avoiding the restrictions discussed here.</p>
<h2><span id="Using_Joomla">Using Joomla</span></h2>
<p>Joomla has a "Custom Reply" that sends emails with the site visitor's from address. You can turn that off in the Joomla dashboard configuration. Go to 'Components -&gt; Contacts -&gt; Options'. On the Form tab, make sure the "Custom Reply" is set to NO.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If this is not done, Joomla may not even generate the email, and might result in the form being non-functional.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For Joomla versions 3.1 or higher, you can access the <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Global_configuration#.E2.80.9CMail_Settings.E2.80.9D_Group">SMTP authentication settings</a> in the Joomla dashboard at 'Site -&gt; Global Configuration -&gt; Server tab -&gt; Mail Settings'. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217071817-Joomla">Joomla overview</a> article for details.</p>
<h2><span id="Using_WooCommerce">Using WooCommerce</span></h2>
<p>WooCommerce includes the <a href="http://docs.woothemes.com/document/configuring-woocommerce-settings/#section-7">option to change</a> the sender ‘from’ name and email address in the 'Settings -&gt; Emails' tab. This should be set to a DreamHost-hosted mail account.</p>
