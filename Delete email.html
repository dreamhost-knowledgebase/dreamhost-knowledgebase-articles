<p>In general, you just need to highlight the emails you wish to delete, then press the <strong>Delete</strong> button on your keyboard. If you click <span class="code">Ctrl +A</span>, all emails in a folder are highlighted.</p>
<p>Any email you deleted is sent to a Trash folder most often named 'Trash'. Open this folder and delete any email. Here are a few links to help you depending on which email client you're using:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Other folders</h3>
<p>As stated above, the Trash and Spam folders older than 15 days are purged automatically. If you find your inbox is still hitting limits, check all of your folders. If you have a large amount of email in your Inbox or any other folder, it's highly recommended to back it up:</p>
