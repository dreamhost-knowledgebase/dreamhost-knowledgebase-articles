<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following steps walk you through converting a Fully Hosted email address into a forward-only address.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Changing your email address from Fully Hosted to forward-only permanently deletes all email stored under that address. Make sure you back up any email you want to save before converting the type of address. View the following article for more information:</p>
