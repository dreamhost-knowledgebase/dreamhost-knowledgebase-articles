<h2>Difference between a fully hosted and forward only email address</h2>
<h3>Fully hosted email address</h3>
<p>A fully hosted email address can send and store emails received.</p>
<h3>Forward only email address</h3>
<p>A forward only email address is only able to forward email that is sent to it.</p>
<p>This type of email address cannot send or store email.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following steps walk you through converting a fully hosted email address into a forward only address.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Changing your email address from fully hosted to forward only will permanently delete all email stored under that address. Make sure you back up any email you want to save before converting the type of address. View the following article for more information:</p>
