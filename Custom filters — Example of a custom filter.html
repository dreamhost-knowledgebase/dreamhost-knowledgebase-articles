<div class="notebox-important">
<p>This example only moves email. It does <strong>NOT</strong> teach the filters to learn what is and is not spam.

<h2 id="h_01HDEN3SC29TMVTRVMJ0YDCYTF">Example headers</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This example shows how to filter mail sent by the Apple Mail application. When an email is sent by this application, the headers will show the following line:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">X-Mailer: Apple Mail</pre>
</div>
<p>The instructions below catch any messages with the same header line and move them into a specific folder.</p>
