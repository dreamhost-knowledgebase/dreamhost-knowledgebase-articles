<p>WHOIS is the tool used to look up domain name registration details. These details contain information about the date the domain was registered, its expiration date, registrant information, nameservers, and the domain registrar. When a domain is registered, ICANN requires that this information is listed in a public database which can be viewed by anyone using the WHOIS protocol.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Due to ICANN's Transfer Policy, any change made to the registrant's name, organization, or email address will put the domain in a 60-day transfer lock; it will also trigger notification emails that are sent to the old and new registrant notifying them of the change.</p>

<p>There are many Internet websites that you can use to view domain registrant information listed in this database.</p>

<p>ICANN requires that domain owners have true and accurate ownership details on file with the registry. They can even force registrars to suspend customer domains if there is inaccurate ownership information listed in the system, and as a domain owner, you are required to list true and accurate ownership details for any domains you register.</p>
<p>As a useful benefit, DreamHost offers free WHOIS privacy for <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004549487-Domain-registration-privacy">most domain extensions</a> that you can register through the DreamHost panel. There are only a few foreign/specialty registries that do not allow WHOIS privacy. You can read more about this service at:</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) broadly requires that the mailing address, phone number, and email address of those owning or administering a domain name are made publicly available through the "WHOIS" database. ICANN is a non-profit organization that coordinates the Internet's global domain name system, and registrars (like DreamHost) must comply by their regulations in order to remain accredited.</p>
<p>You can read more about ICANN <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN">here</a>.</p>
<p>The WHOIS database allows you to instantly obtain information on a given domain name, including who registered it, when it was created, who to contact at that domain, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you begin the domain registration process with DreamHost, the domain is queried in the WHOIS database to see if it is available or not.</p>
