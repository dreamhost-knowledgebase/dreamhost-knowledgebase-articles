<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> is a lightweight database application that does not use a client/server SQL database. This generally works great with most low to medium traffic websites and should manage well on domains that average 100k hits per day.</p>
<h2><span id="SQLite_on_DreamHost_Servers">SQLite on DreamHost Servers</span></h2>
<p>SQLite is pre-installed on DreamHost Shared, VPS, and Dedicated servers. The versions installed are 2.8.17 for sqlite and 3.7.9 for sqlite3. Bindings for C, PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby are already included with the SQLite service.</p>
<p>Performance is acceptable, and may be further improved by setting the appropriate parameters: for example, the new <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/draft/wal.html">Write-Ahead Logging</a> can be enabled by using PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; (SQLite &gt;= 3.7.0).</p>
