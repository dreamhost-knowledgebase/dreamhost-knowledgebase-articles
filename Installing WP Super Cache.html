<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you are using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> (DreamHost's managed WordPress hosting service), caching plugins and optimizations come preinstalled and preconfigured by default. Because of this, DreamPress sites do not need to install WP Super Cache.</p>
</div>
<p>Though <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215525287-WordPress-overview">WordPress</a> is extremely versatile, your site may run less efficiently when it begins to receive more traffic. Since every WordPress page is processed by PHP, it can consume large amounts of memory on your web server when you experience even a moderate amount of traffic. Because WP-Super Cache creates a static file cache of your site and loads that instead of using PHP to generate a page (thus reducing memory usage on your server), it's an outstanding plugin to help improve your site's load time and overall performance.</p>

<p>WP Super Cache is installed automatically when you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-Install-WordPress-using-the-DreamHost-WordPress-installer" target="_self">install WordPress in the panel</a> (if you left the checkbox selected during the installation process).

<p>If you have previously installed any other caching plugin, you should <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215300817#Disabling_plugins">disable and remove</a> it before installing WP Super Cache. In general, double caching is not recommended and can create conflicts that could slow down your WordPress site. Known plugins that conflict with each other are WP Cache and W3 Total Cache.</p>
<p>To remove previously installed caching plugins, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001310966-How-to-log-into-your-WordPress-site" target="_self">log into WordPress</a> and click <span class="text-section">Plugins</span> in the left menu to view and edit your list of plugins.</p>
