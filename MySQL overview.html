<h2>Comparison of MySQL products</h2>
<p>DreamHost shared and VPS products for MySQL run on specialized hardware to optimize disk i/o and therefore the speeds in which they return your query. These are networked products which run independent of the webserver hardware. Dedicated servers offer MySQL that is optimized for other use cases where the webserver and MySQL server co-existing makes more sense.</p>

<td><strong>Shared MySQL</strong></td>
<td>Included with a shared hosting plan, and with a Webserver VPS.</td>
<td align="center">Networked</td>
<td>Standard MySQL for optimized and shared hosting appropriate databases.</td>

<td><strong>MySQL VPS</strong></td>
<td>An additional service similar to a webserver VPS that only runs the MySQL server and no other services.</td>
<td align="center">Networked</td>
<td>High performance MySQL for customers who need higher uptime or have outgrown shared MySQL.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Dedicated MySQL</strong></td>
<td>A dedicated server runs a MySQL server locally along with the other web services.</td>
<td align="center">Local</td>
<td>A dedicated server is ideal for software that sends larges amounts of data between web applications and MySQL, as there is no network in between to limit throughput.</td>
