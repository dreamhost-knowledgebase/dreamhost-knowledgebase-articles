<p>Spam messages are always an unwelcome addition to any website, and unfortunately your WordPress 'Comments' feature may also attract spam at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>The following two options describe how you can either turn off the comments feature altogether and/or use a plugin to help you prevent spam going forward:</p>

<h3>Disabling the comments feature</h3>
<p>The following guide walks you through several options you can select on your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360001310966-How-to-log-into-your-WordPress-site" target="_self">WP-Admin panel</a>, including how to turn off comments site wide (pages and posts), on pages only (but leave on for blog posts), from a WordPress page template, or through the functions file:</p>
