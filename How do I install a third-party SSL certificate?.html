<p>If you would like to purchase an SSL certificate from another company, make sure to first create a CSR at DreamHost before requesting it from your chosen Certificate Authority. That company will then be able to use this CSR to generate your SSL certificate.</p>

<p>If you already have a private key, Certificate Signing Request (CSR), intermediate certificate, and signed SSL certificate (in PEM format), you can install them yourself after setting up <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">Secure Hosting</a> for the domain.</p>

<p>If you already have a signed SSL certificate but do NOT have the corresponding private key, you won't be able install it on DreamHost's servers. Also, do NOT create a private key that is password protected, as the DreamHost panel does not accept these.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you see the error message "key does not match cert", that means that the SSL certificate you're trying to install does not match the private key that is currently installed. This typically means that the Certificate Signing Request that was used to purchase the SSL certificate was not generated with the private key that is in the panel.</p>
