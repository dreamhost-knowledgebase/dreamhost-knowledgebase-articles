<h2>Creating a CSR at DreamHost</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you would like to purchase an SSL certificate from another company, make sure to first create a CSR at DreamHost before requesting it from your chosen Certificate Authority. That company will then be able to use this CSR to generate your SSL certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084098-CSR-overview">CSR overview</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What if I already have my certificate information?</h3>
<p>If you already have a private key, intermediate certificate, and signed SSL certificate, you will still need to have a CSR created at DreamHost before installing. You can then give this CSR to your Certificate Authority who will re-issue the certificate to you. You can then use these new files to install into your DreamHost panel.</p>
<h3>Make sure you have the private key</h3>
<p>If you already have a signed SSL certificate but do NOT have the corresponding private key, you won't be able install it on DreamHost's servers. Also, do NOT create a private key that is password protected, as the DreamHost panel does not accept these.</p>

<p>Some Certificate Authorities put all the SSL certificate files into a .zip file for you. To view the files, make sure to first decompress the zip file.</p>
<p>On a Mac, double click the file.</p>
<p>In Windows, right-click and select 'Extract All'.</p>

<p><strong>Important note about the private key header and footer</strong></p>
<p>If your private key was created with <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5208.txt">PKCS #8 syntax</a>, the header and footer appear like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----</pre>
</div>
<p>In order for the panel to accept this key, you must add <span class="code">RSA</span> to both the header and footer. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----</pre>
</div>
<p>The panel will then accept your key.</p>
</div>

<li>When finished, click the <strong>Proceed with Certificate Configuration</strong> button.</li>
<li>If there aren't any errors, the new certificate is pushed out to the live servers within 15 minutes.

<p>If you see the error message "key does not match cert", that means that the SSL certificate you're trying to install does not match the private key that is currently installed. This typically means that the Certificate Signing Request that was used to purchase the SSL certificate was not generated with the private key that is in the panel.</p>
