<p>Google offers a service that allows you to view your DreamHost email within Gmail. It's called 'Mail Fetcher' which is used to import email. You can use this service instead of forwarding your email to Gmail.</p>
<p>This article explains how to set this up at DreamHost. View the following link from Google for further details:</p>

<p>The instructions in this article only allow you to <strong>IMPORT</strong> existing email from your DreamHost account. Gmail no longer allows you the ability to sync a DreamHost email address to a Gmail address to retrieve future emails. This requires '<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825?ctx=gmail&amp;hl=en&amp;authuser=0">Gmailify</a>' which is not currently available with DreamHost.</p>

<h2>Sending email as your DreamHost address</h2>

<p>When creating a new message, click the down arrow icon for the FROM address. There you can select your DreamHost email before sending.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-04_google_check_email_at_google_05.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>When someone receives the email, it will appear as if it was sent from your DreamHost email account.</p>
<h2>Forwarding email to a Gmail address using a catch-all address</h2>
<p>DreamHost does not allow the forwarding of a legacy "catch-all" address. Any legacy catch-all address previously set up at DreamHost can only receive email. This is because catch-all address are such huge magnets for attracting spam, a large amount of SPAM is inevitably sent to Google.</p>
<p>Unless they change their anti-spam policies, DreamHost is unable to allow legacy catch-all addresses to forward to them, and thus apologizes for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<p>The forwarding of individual email addresses is still allowed, but it's possible Google may rate limit delivery from time to time. The only solution to ensure your email is delivered to Google on time is to set up the 'Mail Fetcher' program to pull your DreamHost email into your Gmail account.</p>
