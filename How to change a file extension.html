<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's sometimes necessary to change a file extension to ensure it functions as intended. For example, if you create a text file on your computer, it's saved with the extension of .txt. </p>
<p>If the file needs to be a phpinfo.php, .htaccess, or phprc file, the extension must be changed or removed. This article explain how to adjust the file extension.</p>

</div><h2>Editing the file extension in Filezilla</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>These instructions assume you've uploaded the file to DreamHost using the links above. Once the file is on the server, log in using an FTP client such as Filezilla.</p>
<p><img alt="Filezilla rename 01" class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Filezilla_rename_file_01.png"/></p>
<p>Right click on the file and choose 'Rename'. Edit the file to remove the .txt extension. Click 'Enter' and the file is immediately saved with the new extension.</p>
</div><h2>Editing the file extension via SSH</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>These instructions assume you've uploaded the file to DreamHost using the links above. Once the file is on the server, log in using your Shell user:</p>

</ul>
<p>Once you have logged into your server via SSH, navigate to the location of the file. You can then rename the file to remove the extension. For example, the following command changes a file titled phpinfo.php.txt to phpinfo.php:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv phpinfo.php.txt phpinfo.php</span></pre>
</div>
<p>This example shows how to remove the extension while also renaming it:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv php.ini phprc</span></pre>
</div>
<p>You can then run <strong>ls -la</strong> to confirm it's been renamed:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ls -la</span></pre>
</div>
