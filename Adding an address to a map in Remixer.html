<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When adding a map, you may see your Google avatar image on the top right. The Google Profile avatar that shows is only shown in your browser session only and shows if you are signed into a Google account.</p>
<p>Your site visitors will not see your Google avatar or save preferences associated with that account. A Google account is also not required to set up a map 'Web Section'.</p>
