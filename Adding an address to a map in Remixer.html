<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After adding a map '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/227703127-Remixer-Web-Sections-">Web Section</a>', you can either enter an address as a postal mailing address, or as a place as permitted by Google Maps. For example: Eiffel Tower.</span></p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The map 'Web Section' only supports a single address location. If you need to show a second address, you must add another map 'Web Section'.</p>

<h2>How to remove the Google avatar within the map</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When adding a map, you may see your Google avatar image on the top right. The Google Profile avatar that shows is only shown in your browser session only and shows if you are signed into a Google account.</p>
<p>Your site visitors will not see your Google avatar or save preferences associated with that account. A Google account is also not required to set up a map 'Web Section'.</p>
