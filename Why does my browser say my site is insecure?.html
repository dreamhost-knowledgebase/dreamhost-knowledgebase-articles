<p>A common issue after adding an SSL certificate is that your browser still shows your site as insecure. This most often happens because there are links on your page that still point to HTTP instead of HTTPS. For example, look at the following code to link an image.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;img src="<span class="command">http</span>://www.example.com/images/pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View"&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice how the URL is directly linked with 'http' at the beginning. When visiting the site in Firefox, the following is displayed:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_SSL_troubleshooting.png" alt="01 SSL troubleshooting.png" width="419" height="380" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see the padlock icon in the top left of the browser shows a warning icon instead.</p>
<h2><span id="Cause_of_this_error">Cause of this error</span></h2>
<p>If you click on the warning icon the text explains that there are 'unencrypted elements' on the page you're viewing.</p>
<p>From the example above, this is happening because the image was linked using 'HTTP' and not 'HTTPS'. Another way to confirm what on your site is linked insecurely is to use the following site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whynopadlock.com/">whynopadlock.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Fixing_unencrypted_elements">Fixing unencrypted elements</span></h2>
<p>There are two solutions:</p>
<h3>Use absolute links</h3>
<p>Absolute links are the full url location to your file. This includes the domain name. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;img src="<span class="command">https</span>://www.example.com/images/pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View"&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>Just make sure you're using HTTPS when linking this way.</p>
<h3>Use relative links</h3>
<p>Relative links do not include the domain name. These links point to a local file instead. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;img src="images/pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View"&gt;</pre>
</div>

<h2>WordPress sites</h2>
<p>There are a few additional steps you must take to secure a WordPress site. View the following article for a list of steps to ensure your WordPress site is using secure links in both the website files and the database.</p>
