<p>When you switch a domain's mail service away from DreamHost, your DreamHost-hosted mail accounts will still remain active but stored emails may not be retained. Be sure to backup all of your stored emails before switching.</p>
<p>Review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215730637-How-do-I-backup-my-email-">Transferring Emails</a> for further instructions.</p>
<p>Webmail can be used to log in to your DreamHost mail accounts, but the webmail.example.com address no longer works. Instead you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webmail.dreamhost.com">http://webmail.dreamhost.com</a> or <a href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a> â€“ Standard Webmail. Use your full email address as the username.</li>
</ul>
<p>For POP3 access and/or to set up a mail client program to download emails to your computer, the server name mail.example.com no longer works. You can find your specific mail cluster in your panel on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.dc&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Data Centers'</a>) page. View the following article for instructions on how to locate your mail servername.</p>
