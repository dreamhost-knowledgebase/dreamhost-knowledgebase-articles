<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>This article should only be used if your email <strong>WAS</strong> hosted at DreamHost but was recently moved to another host. These instructions explain how to view your old email at DreamHost.</p>
<p>If you are hosting your DNS at another company and want to <strong>BEGIN</strong> hosting email at DreamHost, view the following article instead:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>When you switch a domain's mail service away from DreamHost, your DreamHost-hosted mail accounts will still remain active but stored emails may not be retained. Be sure to backup all of your stored emails before switching.</p>
<p>Review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215730637-How-do-I-backup-my-email-">Transferring Emails</a> article for further instructions.</p>
</div>
<h2>Webmail</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Webmail can be used to log in to your DreamHost mail accounts. To connect, use the address&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Email clients</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>For POP3 access and/or to set up a mail client program to download emails to your computer, the server name <strong>mail.example.com</strong> no longer works. View the following article for instructions on how to locate your mail server name.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">How to find your mail servername</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>While some hosts allow you to use the mail server IP address instead of the mail server name, DreamHost does not support mail connections via IP address.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Can I use multiple mail services?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. It is not possible to use multiple mail services under the same domain.</p>
<p>Once you’ve pointed your domain’s MX records to another service, you will no longer receive emails to any DreamHost-hosted mail accounts, and messages sent to mail accounts that you have not recreated at your new mail service will be bounced as undeliverable.</p>
