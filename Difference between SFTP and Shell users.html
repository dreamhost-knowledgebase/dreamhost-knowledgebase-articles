<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>New users are created as SFTP or Shell users. The following explains the difference between these user types.</p>
<h3><span id="SFTP_users">FTP users</span></h3>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>FTP is not considered a secure protocol since all of your traffic (including your login information) is transferred over the Internet in plain text, where anyone could eavesdrop.</p>
<p>For this reason, DreamHost strongly recommends you only use an SFTP or Shell user. If you need to use FTP for any reason, see the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001051531#setting-a-user-to-FTP" target="_self">FTP security</a> article for instructions on how to change the protocol to FTP.</p>
</div>
<h3><span id="SFTP_users">SFTP users</span></h3>
An SFTP user is required in order to upload a website you've created to DreamHost's servers, or to make changes to an existing website.
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001051531-FTP-security">SFTP</a> users are similar to FTP users except that the SFTP protocol uses an encrypted connection to access a server. Port 22 is used in your client to connect to the server via SFTP.</p>
<p>The <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard" target="_self" rel="undefined">Files</a> page shows the username and the type of user it’s configured as.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage_users_show-info.png" alt="manage users show info button" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the following example, the username is 'dh_test_user'. Click the <strong>Show Info </strong>button&nbsp;to display details about this user.</p>

<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-edit-sftp-user.png" alt="manage users edit access settings" width="599" height="274" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here you can see the user is set as an SFTP user.</p>
<h3><span id="Shell_users">Shell users</span></h3>
<p>Shell users are users who can connect via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001051531-FTP-security">SFTP</a>, and (optionally) FTP. The "<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access" target="_self">Shell</a>" is the Linux command line on your hosting server, a useful alternative for advanced users.</p>
