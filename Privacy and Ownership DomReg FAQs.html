<h2>Do I have to make my address and phone number public?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You do not need to post your contact details for your domain registration publicly for the more commonly known TLDs, including .COM/.NET/.ORG/.INFO. DreamHost offers a free privacy protection setting that hides the ownership details for the domain registration on public <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216458227-WHOIS-overview">WHOIS</a> searches. However, only certain TLDs offer this option. Some international TLDs require some information to be posted publicly, but that depends on that domain registry’s policy.</p>
<p>For domains that offer privacy protection, the WHOIS search displays DreamHost’s contact details along with a proxy email address tied to your ownership email address so that it remains hidden, but can still receive messages sent to you regarding the domain name.</p>
<p>View the following article for a list of domains that do not support privacy at DreamHost:</p>

<h2>Is my domain registered under my name or DreamHost's?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The domain registration is registered under the name you set for the owner on the purchase form. It’s not owned under DreamHost.</p>
<p>If you enable privacy protection, the public WHOIS hides your personal ownership details from whomever looks up your domain registration through a WHOIS search. DreamHost’s details appear on the privacy protection search page, but your internal contact and ownership info are listed with the registrar for the owner of that domain name.</p>
<p>Only nonpayment prevents you from having complete control of your domain. Should your account become suspended for a delinquent balance due, DreamHost retains control of the domain – including the right to transfer, sell, or modify it -- until your balance is paid and the account re-enabled. Virtually all registrars operate this way. (DreamHost is an ICANN-accredited registrar.)</p>
