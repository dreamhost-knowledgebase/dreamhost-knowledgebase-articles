</ul>
<h2><span id="confirm-if-your-site-is-down-everywhere">Confirm if your site is down everywhere</span></h2>
<p>The first step to take is to confirm if the site is actually down in all locations, and not just your local computer. There are a couple of ways to do this.</p>
<h3><span id="Is_it_down_for_everyone.2C_or_just_me.3F">Is it down for everyone, or just me?</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downforeveryoneorjustme.com</a>&nbsp;checks if your&nbsp;site is online from a number of locations. It then lets you know if the site is down everywhere, or if only your computer is unable to view it.</p>
<p>If only your computer is unable to view it and you've recently updated your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a>, check this site to see if the new DNS has updated in your location:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">Global DNS Propagation Checker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the DNS has updated, try forcing your browser to reload the page. This clears the cache out of the browser so you see the most recent version of the page.</p>

<h3><span id="Proxy_sites">Proxy sites</span></h3>
<p>Proxy sites allow you to bypass network issues and view the site from a different location. View the following article for a list of proxy sites you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216560958#Proxy_sites">Proxy sites</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the proxy site loads your website, it confirms the site is resolving online. If you still cannot view it, try clearing your cache and flushing DNS:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="is-my-server-up">Is my server up?</span></h2>
<p>If your registration is current and your account has not been suspended, but you canâ€™t reach your domain through a proxy site, check to make sure that your server is up. You can do this by running a traceroute to your server, and by pinging your domain. Instructions for performing these steps are found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840708-Traceroute">Traceroute</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217141537-Collecting-ping-results">Collecting ping results</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot ping the server, or if the traceroute does not complete, please <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a>. If your traceroute shows multiple hops timing out, you would need to contact your ISP for support.</p>
<h2><span id="are-my-files-in-the-correct-spot">Are my files in the correct spot?</span></h2>
<p>Make sure the files for your site are in the correct directory. If they are in the incorrect directory or assigned to the wrong user, the site will not load.</p>
<p>Log into your site via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. Make sure your site files are in the correct directory. View the following article for further details:</p>
