<p>A <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview" target="_self">domain registration</a>&nbsp;designates ownership of the name of your website and can be purchased from any company you like. You can then choose to host the website at the same company, or choose to host at a different company by pointing its <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview" target="_self">DNS records</a>.</p>
<p>While you do not need to have your registration at the same company that you are hosting the site, it makes it easier to manage your website as you can control all of the details from the same location. The following articles explain how to transfer your registration to, or away from, DreamHost:</p>
