<h2>Plan details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check out <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">dreamhost.com</a> for any current promo codes. Customers who add a site while a promotion is active get to keep the this special price even when the promotion is over. If the site is removed from DreamPress (Downgraded or Deleted), or if the customer's account is closed/disabled, they may lose the special promotional pricing.</li>
<li>Downgrading gives a credit for any unused portion of the billing period to be used on another hosting plan.</li>
<li>A 30-day money-back guarantee is available when an annual plan is canceled in the first 30 days. View the '<a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>' page for further details.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional domains</h3>
<p>The original configuration of the Advanced plan comes with 3 sites only. This means you can have 1, 2, or 3 sites on the default 'Advanced' plan. If you want to add more than 3 sites, each new site is billed individually.</p>
<h3>Non-Profit discount</h3>
<p>DreamHost offers US-based 501(c)(3) organizations a discount on DreamPress, managed WordPress hosting. The discount of up to 35% off is good for the life of the plan. View the following article for details:</p>
