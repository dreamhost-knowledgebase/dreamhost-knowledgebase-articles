<p>Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is an effective solution that increases the security of your account. It requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first layer of security is your username and password.</li>
<li>The second layer requires a one-time pass code which you enter before you can gain access to your DreamHost account.</li>
</ul>
<p>This second layer of security helps protect your account from hackers and website hijackers, and DreamHost is proud to provide you with the choice to use either the Google Authenticator app or a Yubikey within the panel.</p>

<h2>Changes to the panel login page</h2>
<p>Once you've enabled Multifactor Authentication, the following panel login screen opens:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/06_Control_Panel.fw.png" alt="06 Control Panel.fw.png" width="499" height="480" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>The following two fields appear:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Multifactor Authentication Code:</strong> Enter the 6-digit passcode generated by your mobile device.</dd>
<dd><strong>Remember this computer?:</strong> From this dropdown menu, choose how long you wish your computer to store this code. The three options are:
<ul>
<li>Don’t remember</li>
<li>Remember for 1 week</li>
<li>Remember for 1 month</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Changes when logging in from a new computer</h2>
<p>Multifactor Authentication uses browser cookies to function. If you try to log in from a new computer that has never logged in to your DreamHost panel before, then the Multifactor Authentication Code field is not initially visible and your first login attempt will fail. After that first attempt, DreamHost will identify your account and make the Multifactor Authentication Code field visible so that you can log in.</p>
