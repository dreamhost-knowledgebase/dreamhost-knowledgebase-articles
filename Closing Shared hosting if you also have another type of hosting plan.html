<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Viewing your hosting plan type</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can view all services billed to your account on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Account</a> page. Here you'll see a list of all services you currently use.</p>

<h2>Remove or migrate Shared users</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If any users still exist on your Shared server, you will not be able to close the plan. You must either delete those users from the Shared server or migrate them to a VPS or Dedicated Server.</p>
<h3>Migrating users to the new VPS or Dedicated Server</h3>
<p>The safest option is to migrate the users to the new server. View the following article for details:</p>

<h3>Deleting users if you no longer need them</h3>
<p>If you no longer need the users on your Shared server you can delete them. However, make sure you backup any important files under the Shared user you wish to keep. View the following articles for information on how to backup your user data:</p>
