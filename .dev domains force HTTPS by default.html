<p>You cannot use a .dev domain/subdomain on <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000760131-Getting-started-with-Remixer">Remixer Cloud Hosting</a> since it does not support HTTPS/SSL certificates. This applies to situations when you publish Remixer Cloud hosted sites using the <strong>Publish</strong> button (not the <strong>Export to WP</strong> button feature, which exports to DreamHost's shared WordPress hosting).</p>

<p>The following describes the .dev domain, and how HTTPS is forced by default.</p>
<h3>What can I find more information on .dev domains?</h3>
<p>The .dev domain is owned by Google.&nbsp;As part of Google's initiative to secure&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003425491-Not-Secure-warning-in-Google-Chrome" target="_self">website connections</a>, .dev domains force HTTPS be default. You can see this is mentioned when originally purchasing the domain registration:</p>

</dl>
<p>Please note that since HTTPS is forced at the registry level by Google, there is no way to override this redirect. The only option is to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview" target="_self">install an SSL certificate</a> to ensure your site does not throw a browser warning.</p>
