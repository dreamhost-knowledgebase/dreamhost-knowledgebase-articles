<p>.dev is a domain owned by Google. As part of Google's initiative to secure <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003425491-Not-Secure-warning-in-Google-Chrome" target="_self">website connections</a>, .dev domains force HTTPS be default. You can see this is mentioned when originally purchasing the domain registration:</p>

</dl>
<p>Please note that since HTTPS is forced at the registry level by Google, there is no way to override this redirect. The only option is to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview" target="_self">install an SSL certificate</a> to ensure your site does not throw a browser warning.</p>
