<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you purchase a domain registration, you may wish to then add a hosting plan in order for it to appear online. There are several hosting options you can choose for your domain:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Fully hosted</a>&nbsp;— your site is hosted on a server and is visible online</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000760131-Getting-started-with-Remixer">Remixer</a>&nbsp;— your site is hosted on the Remixer website builder plan</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525287-WordPress-overview">WordPress</a> — your site is still Fully Hosted, but it's running the software for WordPress</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a>&nbsp;— your site is Fully Hosted and running WordPress, but it's hosted on the DreamPress plan</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1 — Adding a hosting plan</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Account</a> page in your panel.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you do not see a hosting plan listed, add one by clicking the <strong>Add a Shared Hosting Plan</strong> button.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_account_add-shared-hosting.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Once added you'll see it listed on this page under 'Service Plans':</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-08_panel_happy_hosting_plan.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Once the hosting plan has been added, you can proceed to add your domain to it. View the following article for instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">How do I add a domain?</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Step 2 — Make sure your site is pointed to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Even if you set a site to be Fully Hosted in your panel, you need to make sure it’s pointed towards DreamHost (if it's hosted elsewhere). Your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> records must also point to your DreamHost server. The company that hosts your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a> controls your DNS. You can check where the nameservers are pointed by looking up your public WHOIS information here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/">http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the nameservers are set to DreamHost already, then all you need to do is set up hosting. View the following articles for further information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Adding Domains &amp; Subdomains</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Step 3 — Adding an SSL certificate to your website</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's highly recommended you add an SSL certificate to your hosted website in order to ensure that all data transmitted between your site and visitors are safe and secure.</p>
<p>To find out more about adding a certificate to your site, see the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">Adding an SSL certificate overview</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding a Comodo certificate you already purchased to your website</h3>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>On November 1, 2018, Comodo announced that the company is rebranding to Sectigo. For more information about this, please see the following announcement at Sectigo's website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sectigo.com/sectigo-story-faq">Comodo CA Is Now Sectigo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 will reference Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificates issued prior to that will still reference Comodo. These are still the same company, and the only difference is the name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you have already purchased a certificate, click the <strong>Add</strong> button next to the domain on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page, and then click Comodo's (<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360022370112-Comodo-name-change-to-Sectigo">Sectigo</a>)&nbsp;<strong>Select this Certificate</strong> button where it shows '$0/paid'.</p>
