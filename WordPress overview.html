<h2>What you need before installing</h2>
<p>Before you install WordPress, you must first have an active <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">hosting plan</a> such as a Shared, VPS, or Dedicated hosting plan.</p>
<p>Next, you'll need to have purchased a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>. If you have already purchased a domain registration at another company, you'll need to point your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">A records</a> to DreamHost.

<h2>Using WordPress automatic updates</h2>
<p>As of version 3.7, WordPress now features automatic updates. These are for minor revision updates only (for example, 4.1 to 4.1.1) .</p>
<p>DreamHost strongly recommends that you allow these updates to occur automatically as they usually include important security updates or bug fixes.</p>
