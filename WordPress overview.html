<p>Next, you'll need to have purchased a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>.

<h2>Using WordPress automatic updates</h2>
<p>As of version 3.7, WordPress now features automatic updates. These are for minor revision updates only (for example, 4.1 to 4.1.1) .</p>
<p>DreamHost strongly recommends that you allow these updates to occur automatically as they usually include important security updates or bug fixes.</p>
