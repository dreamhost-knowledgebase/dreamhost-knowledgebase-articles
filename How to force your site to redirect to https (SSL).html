<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can force your site to redirect to its secure URL by creating a configuration file and adding some code to it. To create this file, you must log into your server via FTP or SSH as described below.</p>
<p>When you add an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">SSL certificate</a> to your website, the URL visitors use to view your site changes from HTTP to HTTPS. The 'S' ensures that your connection is encrypted.</p>
<p>After adding an SSL certificate you should force all URLs on your site to automatically redirect to the HTTPS version. For example, if someone visited:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>http://example.com/page1</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>you'd want it to automatically redirect to:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>https://example.com/page1</strong></dd>
</dl>

<p>It's not possible to use the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377#redirect_to_https">panel's Redirect option</a> with an SSL certificate as this removes hosting from the domain. The only option is to create a custom file to redirect your site to https.</p>

<h2>What configuration file do I need to create?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This depends on your server type. For example, your server is either running Apache or Nginx.</p>
<h3>For Apache servers</h3>
<p>The majority of all DreamHost customers are running their site on an Apache server. In this case you'd just need to create an .htaccess file for your site.</p>

</ul>
<h3>For Nginx servers</h3>
<p>If your site is running on a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-VPS-overview-">VPS</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> server, and you have manually <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214880148-How-to-change-your-web-server-to-Nginx">configured it to run Nginx instead</a>, you need to create a redirects.conf file. View the link below for further information.</p>

<p>Unless you've manually <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214880148-How-to-change-your-web-server-to-Nginx">changed your VPS or Dedicated server to run Nginx</a>, you are using Apache.</p>
