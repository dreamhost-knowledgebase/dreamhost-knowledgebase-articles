<p>When you add an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">SSL certificate</a> to your website, the URL visitors use to view your site changes from HTTP to HTTPS. The 'S' ensures that your connection is encrypted.</p>
<p>After adding an SSL certificate you should force all URLs on your site to automatically redirect to the HTTPS version. For example, if someone visited:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>http://example.com/page1</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>you'd want it to automatically redirect to:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>https://example.com/page1</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can make sure your site redriects to the secure URL by creating a configuration file.</p>
<h2>What configuration file do I need to create?</h2>
<p>This depends on your server type. Most often your server is running Apache. In this case you'd just need to create an .htaccess file. If your server is running Nginx instead, you'd create a redirects.conf file. View the links below for further information.</p>
