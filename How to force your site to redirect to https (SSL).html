<p>When you add an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">SSL certificate</a> to your website, the URL visitors use to view your site changes from HTTP to HTTPS. The 'S' ensures that your connection is encrypted.</p>
<p>After adding an SSL certificate you should force all URLs on your site to automatically redirect to the HTTPS version. For example, if someone visited:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>http://example.com/page1</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>you'd want it to automatically redirect to:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>https://example.com/page1</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can make sure your site redirects to the secure URL by creating a configuration file.</p>
<h2>What configuration file do I need to create?</h2>
<p>This depends on your server type. Most often your server is running Apache. In this case you'd just need to create an .htaccess file.</p>
<p>If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-VPS-overview-">VPS</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> server has been <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214880148-How-to-change-your-web-server-to-Nginx">configured to run Nginx instead</a>, you'd create a redirects.conf file.
