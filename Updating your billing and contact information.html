<p>If your billing details or contact information change, you must update your information in your panel so you do not miss any important notices. The panel also shows who is designated as the owner of the account and who is authorized to contact DreamHost support for account specific issues.</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to your DreamHost panel directly in your DreamHost panel at <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">https://panel.dreamhost.com</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.over&amp;">Panel &gt; 'HOME' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.
