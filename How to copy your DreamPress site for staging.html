<p>You can use as a new feature in the DreamHost web panel that allows you to copy your staging site to an existing site. A staging instance allows you to test your DreamPress website before it goes live.</p>
<p>The following describes how to copy, password protect, and delete a staging website using the DreamHost web panel.</p>
<h2>Creating a staging website</h2>
<p>View the following article to add a DreamPress temporary domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115002837508-Creating-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain">Creating a DreamPress temporary domain</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This site can be named anything, but it's recommended you use your domain name followed by dream.press. For example, if your site is 'example.com', create a temporary site named 'example.dream.press'.</p>
<p>After it's created, you'll receive an email with your new username and a link to create a password. You can then log in at example.dream.press/wp-admin.</p>
<h2>Using the 'Copy site' option</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Select a destination site from the drop-down list (you can also use a Shared site as a staging environment), and then click the yellow 'Start Now' button.</li>
Once your website is finished copying to your staging site, and email is sent to you that confirms the details.</ol>
<h2>Password-protecting your site</h2>
<p>Because a staging site may diminish the SEO ranking of your live site, DreamHost recommends that you password-protect your staging site.</p>
<h2>Deleting a staging site</h2>
<p>After you set up a staging site, and then decided you'd prefer to use that as your full production site, you can delete the staging instance.</p>
