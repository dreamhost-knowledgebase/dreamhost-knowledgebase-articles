<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're using Cloudflare without a subdomain, then you must select ‘Add WWW’ to the domain. This is a limitation that Cloudflare imposes when adding their service through DreamHost. If you wish to use Cloudflare without the www subdomain, you must purchase an account directly through their website.</p>
<p>If your domain is already a subdomain, such as <strong>subdomain.example.com</strong>, then there is no need to change the domain hosting options and you can configure Cloudflare on <strong>subdomain.example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>If your domain uses a content management application like WordPress, this can cause an issue as the URL used by the application has changed. If you need to change your domain to include WWW in the URL, you must make sure to update the URL used in your application or code as well. It’s best to make the changes to your CMS program or code before enabling Cloudflare on the domain.</p>

<p><strong>DreamHost nameservers</strong></p>
<p>If your domain's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are pointed to DreamHost, the Cloudflare plan you added to your DreamHost panel will automatically connect to your domain.</p>
<p><strong>NON-DreamHost nameservers</strong></p>
<p>If your domain's nameservers are <strong>NOT</strong> pointed to DreamHost, its DNS records are controlled at a different company. In order to use the Cloudflare subscription in your DreamHost panel, you must point your DNS to DreamHost using one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point your nameservers (recommended)</li>
<li>Point individual A Records</li>
</ul>
<p>The best option is to point your nameservers to DreamHost since this points ALL of your DNS records to DreamHost.</p>
<p>The only reason to not point your nameservers is if you have specific services you need to continue hosting at another company. In that case, you would need to manually set up individual A records at the host where your domain's nameservers are currently managed.&nbsp;View the following article for instructions on how to confirm where your domain's nameservers are pointed.</p>

</ul>
<p>You can then use the following article to locate your DreamHost domain's IP addresses. These are the values you use to create A Records at the company where your nameservers are pointing.</p>

</ul>
<p>You'll need to create the following A Records.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>example.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Or if you're using a subdomain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>subdomain.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The new DNS records will then take a few hours to update online.</p>

<h2>Changing the Cloudflare account</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's only possible to change the account within the primary domain (<strong>www.example.com</strong>). Subdomains such as <strong>blog.example.com</strong> cannot change the Cloudflare account assigned to them. View the following article for further information:</p>
