<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On DreamHost Shared and Private MySQL servers, some of the SQL commands are not available for scripting nor in phpMyAdmin. Their functionality is available instead through the DreamHost control panel. </p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CREATE DATABASE: only works from the shell if you previously created a database with the specified same name using your DreamHost Panel and then dropped it at some point. You should use --drop-database with mysqldump when backing up a database.</li>
<li>GRANT</li>
<li>REVOKE</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table summarizes the privileges a MySQL user at DreamHost may have, as compared to all available privileges.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>This table relates to Shared MySQL servers as well as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">Private MySQL servers</a>. Only if you upgrade to a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated server</a> where the MySQL database is on the local machine would the table below not apply.</p>
