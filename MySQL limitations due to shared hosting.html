<h2><span id="MySQL_limitations_due_to_shared_hosting">MySQL limitations due to shared hosting</span></h2>
<p>On DreamHost shared accounts, some of the SQL commands listed in the MySQL documentation link below or in references such as the O'Reilly book <em>Managing &amp; Using MySQL</em> by Reese, et al., are not available for scripting nor in phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>Their functionality is available instead through the DreamHost control panel. </p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CREATE DATABASE: only works from the shell if you previously created a database with the specified same name using your DreamHost Panel and then dropped it at some point. You should use --drop-database with mysqldump when backing up a database.</li>
<li>GRANT</li>
<li>REVOKE</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table summarizes the privileges a MySQL user at DreamHost may have, as compared to all available privileges.</p>

<p>This table relates to Shared MySQL servers as well as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">Private MySQL servers</a>. Only if you upgrade to a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated server</a> where the MySQL database is on the local machine would the table below not apply.</p>
