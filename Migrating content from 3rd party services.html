<h2>Understanding the Migrations Page</h2>
<p>The 'Migrations' tab makes it easy to copy buckets or containers from other object storage services supporting S3 or Swift compatible APIs.</p>

<h4>Bucket naming convention conflicts</h4>
<p>If the naming conventions used for your S3 buckets or Swift Containers are not compatible with the naming conventions for DreamObjects, a Bucket Name Conflicts screen appears:</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Currently, Bucket names using capital letters cannot be imported because capital letters can create DNS issues. If you have S3 Buckets or Swift Containers that use capital letters, you are asked to change their names. If you wish, you can use dashes (as pictured above) or dots to separate words.</p>
<p>To avoid any issues, modify your bucket names to resolve any naming conflicts, then click the <strong>Resolve Conflicts</strong> button.</p>

<h4>Viewing migrations</h4>
<p>Once a Migration has been successfully added, it is viewable on the DreamObjects 'Migration' tab. Migrations are grouped as either Active or Completed:</p>

<div id="understanding-the-status-of-migration-buckets">
<h4>Understanding the status of migration Buckets</h4>
<p>You can obtain information on the status of individual buckets by clicking the <strong>View Buckets</strong> button to display the buckets for your Migration:</p>
<div class="figure"><img src="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/article_attachments/218809928/Mig10.png" alt="../../_images/Mig10.png" /></div>
<p>Migrated and migrating Buckets reflect one of the following five states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Queued</strong> — the Bucket or Container and all of its objects have been successfully copied to DreamObjects.</li>
<li><strong>In Progress</strong> — the Bucket or Container is in the process of being copied to DreamObjects and has not yet completed the action.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped</strong> — the migration process for the Bucket or Container has either failed, or was manually stopped by the user requesting the migration.</li>
<li><strong>Partial</strong> — some Buckets or Containers and their contents have been migrated, and some have not. This may have been caused by a failure during Object Synchronization. Such failures can be caused by deleting your S3 or Swift Buckets, or by revoking your S3 or Swift credentials before the migration is complete.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong> — the Bucket or Container and all of its objects have been successfully copied to DreamObjects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
