<h2 id="h_01HY1J23KG9X5RF7XGF56J7TRC">Common reasons</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following are a few common causes that will make your site throw a 500 error.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGC71F5J7AYG9MZRV9">Check your error log</h3>
<p>A good first step in troubleshooting this is to check your site's error log to see what the issue may be. View the following article for information on how to view your site's error log file.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGDBH5ZW6G96N1GTXN">Permissions</h3>
<p>Every file and directory under your website needs to have specific permissions set to run correctly. These permissions will differ based on your site's needs, but if they are set incorrectly, your site may display a 500 error.</p>
<p>In general, files and directories should be set as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>files&nbsp;— 644</li>
<li>directories&nbsp;— 755</li>
</ul>
<p>The following articles show how to adjust these permissions.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGVRV0JS627VJ0JZCK">.htaccess file</h3>
<p>Many sites use an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file to control how the site operates. View the following article for further details.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview" target="_self">.htaccess overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the code in this file is written incorrectly, or the server is not able to run the code, a 500 error may be thrown. Your site's error log file should indicate what line in your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file is the cause.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGQ303MPRV3TJBTX7J">Timeout when connecting to an external server</h3>
<p>If your site is making connections to an external server, it's possible the connection will time out. If so, this may result in a 500 error. The following article shows how to raise your PHP execution time using a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.</p>

</ul>
<p>However, it's ultimately up to the other server to respond in time.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KG571518FHJ1HR8GRE">Hitting the PHP memory limit</h3>
<p>Hitting the PHP memory could also cause a 500 error. View the following article for instructions on how to raise this limit.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGCKR3M3D3GWYNE40H">Syntax errors</h3>
<p>Syntax errors in our website's code could throw a 500 error. Check your site's error log or enable error logging within your programming language to catch such issues.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HY1J23KG0PWSRCR5N4V0SG59">WordPress</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>WordPress is run using the PHP programming language, so everything above still applies. However there a few additional things that could cause this error with a WordPress site.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGQZ532N3DE4J2PNXS">Plugins</h3>
<p>Try disabling your plugins. This can be done by renaming your plugins folder. The following article walks you through how to do this.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HY1J23KGZDHHZCP5Q4QQZRC2">Reinstall your core WordPress files</h3>
<p>If none of the solutions above fix your problem, you may need to reinstall your core WordPress files. This downloads a new copy of your WordPress <span class="text-object">/wp-admin</span> and <span class="text-object">/wp-includes</span> directories and could potentially fix your site if something with those files were causing the 500 error. View the following article for instructions on how to do this.</p>
