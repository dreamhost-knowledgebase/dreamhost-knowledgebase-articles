<p>DreamHost no longer offers admin (sudo) access on DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> instances.</p>
<p>This article details why this was done along with examples of how to manage your VPS without admin (sudo) access.</p>
<h1><span id="Why_are_admin_users_being_removed.3F" class="mw-headline">Why are admin users being removed?</span></h1>
<p>DreamHost currently manages all private servers to provide quick and reliable updates necessary for the security and stability of the server. However, when users take server management into their own hands with the "sudo" command, it directly limits DreamHost's ability to provide a safe and reliable managed hosting environment.</p>
<h1><span id="Can_I_opt-out_of_the_admin_removal.3F" class="mw-headline">Can I opt-out of the admin removal?</span></h1>
<p>If you wish to opt-out of the admin removal, please contact <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">DreamHost support</a> with specific details as to why you need this feature.</p>
<p>Please note that in the future, all admin users will be removed from all VPS machines.</p>

<p>Most software does not need to be compiled into the operating system directly as root. You can generally install it to your home directory and run it as your non-root user. This can also be a more secure way to run these programs.</p>
<p>Below are a few examples with links that show how to manage your VPS without admin (sudo) access.</p>

<p>The good news, for users looking to have more control over their hosting environment is that DreamHost's cloud computing service, <a class="external text" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/" rel="nofollow">DreamCompute</a>, is completely unmanaged.</p>
<p>You can install whatever software you like on it. Don't need a web server? No problem! DreamHost provides you with a base OS install (or you can even upload your own). On this machine, you can use sudo or log in as root if you want.</p>
<p>DreamCompute provides the full and complete remote server control that so many DreamHost VPS users have been craving for years. View the following article for further details:</p>
