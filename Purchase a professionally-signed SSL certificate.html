<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article only explains how to purchase a Professionally-Signed SSL certificate in your DreamHost panel. This type of certificate&nbsp;costs $15/year and is signed by Sectigo, displaying a certificate seal of trust on your site.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 references Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificate issued prior to this date references Comodo. Both names&nbsp;<a href="https://sectigo.com/comodo" target="_self">refer to the same company</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>This type of certificate is recommended for eCommerce sites, customer login areas, or any other site that transmit sensitive information.</p>
</div>
<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Confirmation email address</h3>
<p>Before you begin the process to purchase an SSL certificate, make sure you have already created a confirmation email address on your domain. This email may be necessary to finalize the purchase.</p>
<p>This email must be an address on your domain. For example, if your website is <strong>example.com</strong>, make sure you have already created one of the following addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">admin@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">administrator@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">hostmaster@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">postmaster@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">webmaster@example.com</span></li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to create an email address:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215029918-Add-an-email-address">Add an email address</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Your email can be hosted at another company, you just need to make sure that one of the addresses above is active and able to receive email.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>CAA records</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>CAA records can be created by a website owner to specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are permitted to issue SSL certificates for a domain.</p>
<p>View the following article if you'd like to add CAA records to your domain before purchasing an SSL certificate.</p>

<h2>Purchasing a Signed Certificate in the DreamHost panel</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter your personal and website information.
<ul>
<li>You must fill in ALL of the fields (including the 'Organization name') in order to successfully proceed to the next step. If you don't have an organization name, then enter your first and last name. 'Street 2' and 'Street 3' are optional fieldsâ€”you can leave those blank if your address does not include any of this info (such as an apt. #).</li>
<li>This information is used to generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that is used to generate your new professionally-signed SSL certificate.</li>
</ul>
Click the&nbsp;<strong>Proceed to Next Step</strong>&nbsp;button when finished.

</dl>
</li>
<li>On the next page, select one of your domain's email addresses from the dropdown list, and then click the&nbsp;<strong>Proceed to Next Step&nbsp;</strong>button.
<div class="notebox-important">
<p><strong>Confirmation address</strong></p>
<p>This must be an email on your domain.&nbsp;Make sure one of the emails listed in that dropdown has been created on your domain and you are able to receive mail with it. If it does not exist, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217139407-Email-quickstart-guide">create this email first</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify. So it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h2>What happens after you purchase it?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Email from DreamHost</h3>
<p>You'll soon receive an email from support@dreamhost.com at the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order. This is just a confirmation of your purchase, but it may also ask you to click a link to verify your contact info.</p>
<h3>Email from Sectigo</h3>
<p>You may also receive a second email from Sectigo. This is part of the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001402683-What-is-the-DCV-process-">DCV process</a> to verify your domain. This is the last option in the DCV process, so it's possible you never receive this email. If you do receive this email from Sectigo, proceed through the steps to complete the verification of your domain.</p>
<dl>
<dd></dd>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Most orders are completed and installed within 2 hrs of them being approved, however, it could take up to 24 hrs to fully process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Installing the Sectigo certificate on your website</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At this point, you have only purchased the Sectigo certificate. It is <strong>NOT</strong> installed yet. You can see on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page that it's listed as 'Order Processing'.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-ssl-sectigo-processing.png" width="564" height="100" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>When you click the <strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>button to the right, you'll see a 'Temporary' certificate is currently installed, which can be viewed under the <span class="text-object">Current Certificate</span> tab:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/ssl-panel-sectigo-july-2020_05.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>A temporary certificate is only active while your Sectigo certificate is in the process of installing. Once installed, your Sectigo certificate takes its place and becomes the only active certificate on your domain.</p>
<p>Once the Sectigo certificate is active, the following displays on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page to the right of the domain.</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-ssl-sectigo.png" width="119" height="50" /></p>
</div>
<h2>Test if the SSL certificate is working</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The certificate is now installed on your domain. Visit the secure URL of your website at:</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://</strong>example.com</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" alt="Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see the browser bar shows a <span class="text-object">lock</span> icon confirming the connection is secure.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you just installed the certificate, you may need to wait a few hours for it to update online.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS by default</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in <span class="text-object">https</span> before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (<span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>):</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After installing your certificate, you may find that your browser is still showing an insecure warning when visiting the <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> version of your URL. There are a few reasons this could occur. Please view the following article for instructions on how to resolve this issue.</p>
