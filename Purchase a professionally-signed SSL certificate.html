<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article only explains how to purchase a professionally signed SSL certificate in your DreamHost panel.</p>
<p>This type of certificate is recommended for eCommerce sites, customer login areas, or any other site that transmits sensitive information as it is signed by Sectigo, displaying a certificate seal of trust on your site.</p>

<p><strong>Create a confirmation email address</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin the process of purchasing an SSL certificate, make sure you have already <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217139407-Add-an-email-address">created a confirmation email address on your domain</a> since this email may be necessary to finalize the purchase. For example, any of the following will work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="text-object">admin</span>@example.com</li>
<li>
<span class="text-object">administrator</span>@example.com</li>
<li>
<span class="text-object">hostmaster</span>@example.com</li>
<li>
<span class="text-object">postmaster</span>@example.com</li>
<li>
<span class="text-object">webmaster</span>@example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Your email can be hosted at another company; it just needs to exist and be able to receive email. </p>
<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email, and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify, so it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>Panel installation process</strong></p>
<p>Most orders are completed and installed within 2 hrs of being approved; however, it could take up to 24 hrs to fully process fully.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Order Processing</strong>: After purchasing, the certificate displays as 'Order Processing' on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page. This means it is <strong>NOT</strong> yet installed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Certificate On Order</strong>: When you click the <strong>Settings </strong> button to the right, you'll see that the certificate is in the order process.</li>
<li>Once installed, your Sectigo certificate takes its place and becomes the only active certificate on your domain.</li>

This is the last option in the DCV process, so it's possible you never receive this email.
