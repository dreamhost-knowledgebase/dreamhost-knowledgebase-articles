<p>It's extremely important to make sure your plugins are compatible with the version of WordPress you're using.&nbsp;This is something you can verify at <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress' Plugin Directory</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HP8ATN5CRQQBTYVMBWTW1KVM" class="subtoc-heading">Locating your WordPress version</h3>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Some new plugins may not appear on the <span class="text-object">Add Plugins</span> page within your WordPress dashboard. In those cases, you can instead download and install it manually to your WordPress site. See the following article for more information:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>Log into your WordPress site.</li>
<li>In the left menu, navigate to <span class="text-section">Plugins &gt; Add New</span>.</li>
<li>Search for the name of the plugin. This example installs 'UpdraftPlus'. Once found, click the <strong>Install Now</strong> button.</li>
<li>Back on the 'Plugins' page, make sure to click 'Activate' under the plugin.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="Updating_plugins" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h3 id="h_01HP8ATN5D8S9HSYM5G203XJ7N" class="subtoc-heading">Updating plugins</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You should also confirm that the plugins are using the most recent version. Updating your plugins can help with security issues as well as performance improvements. You can see in your WordPress panel if a plugin has an update available.</p>
<p>Click 'Plugins' in the left pane. You can then view all of your plugins and which ones have updates available.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>As stated above, make sure the new version of the plugin is compatible with the current version of WordPress you're using. You can usually find this information on the plugin's web page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HP8ATN5DXQ8FDQ82BJ9Q0421" class="subtoc-heading">Confirming if a plugin is compatible with your WordPress version</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If an update is available, you should then check its plugin page. For example, you can visit the following page for the 'Akismet' plugin, which shows you the version number:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: 600;">Making a bulk update</span></p>
<p>You can also click the dropdown at the top of the list. Select ‘Update’ from the <span class="text-object">Bulk Actions</span> dropdown, and then click 'Apply' to update all plugins in that list. However, it's recommended to confirm the newer versions are compatible with your version of WordPress first.</p>

<div id="Disabling_plugins" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 id="h_01HP8ATN5D003AWJZY6AXBNPZ2">Disable a plugin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are experiencing site slowness, and you want to see if it's resource-usage related (and not something on DreamHost's end), simply disable all your plugins and switch to the default theme.</p>
<p>If your WordPress installation is suddenly running faster, then it’s recommended to go through your plugins and enable them one-by-one, to see if any of them is using more resources than the others. The following two-step process describes how to do that.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HP8ATN5DWTE1XCJZ642EW5ZB" class="subtoc-heading">Step one: disabling a plugin</h3>
<p>The fastest way to disable plugins is by renaming the folder on the server.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. (This example uses <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a>).</li>
<li>Make sure you're in your WordPress site's directory.</li>
<li>Navigate into the <span class="text-object">/wp-content</span> directory.&nbsp;Here you can see the <span class="text-object">/plugins</span> directory.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border solvvy-hidden" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Filezilla_rename_plugin_directory.png" alt="Filezilla rename plugin directory" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Rename the <span class="text-object">/plugins</span> directory to <span class="text-object">/plugins_OFF</span>. This immediately disables all plugins.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border solvvy-hidden" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Plugins_OFF.png" alt="Plugins OFF.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Test your site again to see if this helped solve your issue.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01HP8ATN5DB1255R5REPAD1QYY" class="subtoc-heading">Step two: renaming the plugin</h3>
<p>If you find your site suddenly improves, you know one of your plugins was causing the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename the <span class="text-object">/plugins_OFF</span> directory back to <span class="text-object">/plugins</span>.</li>
<li>Click into the <span class="text-object">/plugins</span> folder to view all of your plugins.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border solvvy-hidden" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Rename_plugins.png" alt="Rename plugins.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Rename them one at a time to disable them. As you rename them one at a time, load your site to see if that plugin was the one causing the issue.</li>
<li>Once you find out which plugin is the culprit, contact the developer directly. All WordPress.org hosted plugins and themes have a support forum.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="Maintenance_mode" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 id="h_01HP8ATN5DHSBH4VGCVDNNWMX5">Jetpack plugin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The <strong>Jetpack</strong> plugin is a bit special. You might try disabling individual modules in the plugin to improve performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="Stats_Plugins" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 id="h_01HP8ATN5D0EC87HJQVDNTQ9VY">Stats plugin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>While having a plugin that handles your stats (and displays them in your admin interface) is nice, they can actually inflate the database almost as quickly as unchecked spam. This means you should be cautious of using them and pay special attention to your database if you do so. Optimally, you'd use something that doesn't depend on your server environment like <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="notebox-important">
