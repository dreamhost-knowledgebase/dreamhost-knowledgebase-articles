<p>Each directory has a specific set of permissions applied to it to restrict what users can do within that directory. The definition for each permission are as following:</p>
<p>Users can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RETR</strong> – download files</li>
<li><strong>LIST</strong> – view the directories contents</li>
<li><strong>CD</strong> – change directories</li>
<li><strong>STOR</strong> – upload files</li>
<li><strong>DELETE</strong> – delete files</li>
<li><strong>RENAME</strong> – rename files</li>
</ul>

<p>It's very important to set up the permissions correctly or you could inadvertently allow your anonymous FTP service to become abused by hackers. If a new Anonymous FTP service is exposed, hackers can test it for vulnerabilities by attempting to upload a file and then download it again (the default configuration does allow that). If successful, hackers can upload all of their illegal files to your site and give out the address of your anonymous FTP service to anyone.</p>

<p>The screenshot above shows a basic configuration in order to prevent an attempt to maliciously use the anonymous FTP service. Of course, you can modify it to meet your needs later, but this is an example on how to keep it safe.</p>
<p>This configuration allows users to "RETR" download files that are placed into the /(root) directory but can only "STOR" upload files into the /incoming directory. Since they cannot download files uploaded into the /incoming directory, you're safe. However, this may not meet your requirements . You should experiment with the configuration until you find one that works best for your needs.</p>
