<p>Hot linking or bandwidth stealing is a common problem. It happens when people link to files and images on a different server and display them on their own website; this uses the bandwidth of the original owner at their expense.</p>

<h2>What to change in the examples below?</h2>
<p>The examples below can be entered into your .htaccess file exactly as shown.</p>
<p>Only if the example contains a URL in bold should you change that to your actual URL. For example, if you see the domain 'example.com', change this to your own domain name.</p>
<h2>Adding code to your .htaccess file</h2>
<p>By entering the lines below into an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess file</a>, you can prevent hotlinking to your website:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://(www\.)?<span class="command">example.com</span>/.*$ [NC] 
RewriteRule \.(gif|jpg)$ http://<span class="command">www.example.com/hotlink.gif</span> [R,L]
</pre>
</div>
<p>In the example above, change 'example.com' to your website URL. This causes any hotlinked image to fail to load. You can change the last line to point to any image you like. This image should explain that hot linking is disabled on your server.</p>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://<span class="command">example.com</span>.*$ [NC] 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://<span class="command">www.example.com</span>.*$ [NC] 
RewriteRule .*\.(gif|jpg|jpeg|bmp)$ http://<span class="command">www.example.com/stophotlinking.jpg</span> [R,NC] 
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can change the last line to point to any image you like. This image should explain that hot linking is disabled on your server.</p>
<p>If you don't wish to take the manual approach, you can prevent hotlinking by enabling it in the panel. To enable, navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.webdav&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'Htaccess/WebDAV'</a>) page. Click on your domain and proceed with the steps to enable this feature.</p>
<h2><span id="Blocking_specific_domains">Blocking specific domains</span></h2>
<p>The following code fails to load a hotlinked file, but no error is thrown. So, if the site example.com contains a hotlinked image to your site, it would fail to load on their site:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^http://(www\.)?<span class="command">example\.com</span>(/.*)*$ [NC,OR]
RewriteRule \.(jpeg|JPEG|jpe|JPE|jpg|JPG|gif|GIF|png|PNG|mng|MNG)$ - [F]
</pre>
</div>
<p>To protect other resources, such as video and audio files, add additional extensions to the RewriteRule parentheses block.</p>
<h2><span id="Allowing_only_specific_domains">Allowing only specific domains</span></h2>
<p>The following code only allows specific sites to load content. For example, the site example.com has all of the content. The following code allows <strong>only</strong> example.com and dreamhost.com to load the content. All other sites attempting to request any resource fail to load the resource, but no errors are thrown:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://<span class="command">(www\.)?dreamhost\.com</span>(/.*)*$ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://<span class="command">(www\.)?example\.com</span>(/.*)*$ [NC]
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteRule \.(jpeg|gif|png)$ - [F]
</pre>
</div>
<p>In addition, since a user agent may not always specify an HTTP_REFERER value, the RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$ line allows the request to go through if the HTTP_REFERER value consists of a blank string.</p>
