<p>DreamObjects allows you to set public and private permissions on Buckets and Objects. These permissions control what information is available when accessing the Bucket or Objects within it.</p>
<h2>Bucket permissions</h2>
<p>You can view your Bucket's permissions on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Cloud' &gt; 'DreamObjects'</a>) page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your username to expand your Bucket list.

</li>
<li>To the right of a Bucket, click the 'Change Settings' link.

</dl>
</li>
<li>In the pop-up you'll see a 'PERMISSIONS' toggle. Click to toggle between public and private permissions for this Bucket.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What does this change?</h3>
<p>Bucket permissions control what information is able to be viewed publicly online.</p>
<p>If a Bucket has public permissions, visiting the URL of the bucket will display a list of its contents. For example, this bucket has two images named 'lake-public.jpg' and 'lake-private.jpg'.</p>

</dl>
<p>You can see above the names of the Objects are displayed along with the username of the Bucket.</p>
<p>If the Buckets permissions were set to private, you would not see the contents or username. You would only see this 'Access Denied' message:</p>

</dl>
<h2>Object permissions</h2>
<p>Object permissions control how an individual Object within a Bucket can be viewed.</p>
<p>You can view your Bucket's permissions on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Cloud' &gt; 'DreamObjects'</a>) page after opening your Bucket.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your username to expand your Bucket list.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_05.png" alt="DreamObjects Permissions" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>View Objects</strong> button at the bottom. This opens a pop-up box.</li>
<li>Click your Bucket name in the left pane to display a list of your Objects. In this example, the Bucket only has two Objects names 'lake-public.jpg' and 'lake-private.jpg'.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_06.png" alt="DreamObjects Permissions" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click on an Object to view its permissions.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_07.png" alt="DreamObjects Permissions" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>You'll see a permissions toggle button. Clicking this changes the URL link to the Object. The example above shows a public URL. If you visit it, you'll see the image.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_08.png" alt="DreamObjects Permissions" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>The example above shows a private URL. It is a long strand of random characters that is only valid for a temporary time period. You can set this period in the 'Expires' dropdown menu. You'll only be able to view this image if you're using this private URL. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Can I view my Objects in a private bucket?</h2>
<p>Yes. It does not matter if the Bucket's permissions are set to Public or Private, you will always be able to view your Objects when using the Object's correct URL.</p>
<h2>Does changing a Bucket's permissions change the permissions of Objects within it?</h2>
<p>No. Changing the Bucket's permissions does not change any of the Object's permissions. They will remain the same.</p>
