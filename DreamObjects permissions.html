<p>DreamObjects allows you to set public and private permissions on Buckets and Objects. These permissions control what information is available when accessing the Bucket or Objects within it.</p>
<h2>Bucket permissions</h2>
<p>You can view your Bucket's permissions on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DreamObjects</a> page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your username to expand your Bucket list.

</dl>
</li>
<li>To the right of a Bucket, click the 'Change Settings' link.

</dl>
</li>
<li>In the pop-up you'll see a 'PERMISSIONS' toggle. Click to toggle between public and private permissions for this Bucket.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What does this change?</h3>
<p>Bucket permissions control what information is able to be viewed publicly online.</p>
<p>If a Bucket has public permissions, visiting the URL of the bucket will display a list of its contents. For example, this bucket has two images named 'lake-public.jpg' and 'lake-private.jpg'.</p>

<dd><img alt="DreamObjects Permissions" class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_03.png"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see above the names of the Objects are displayed along with the username of the Bucket.</p>
<p>If the Buckets permissions were set to private, you would not see the contents or username. You would only see this 'Access Denied' message:</p>

</dl>
<h2>Object permissions</h2>
<p>Object permissions control how an individual Object within a Bucket can be viewed.</p>
<p>You can view your Bucket's permissions on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DreamObjects</a> page after opening your Bucket.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your username to expand your Bucket list.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="DreamObjects Permissions" class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_05.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>View Objects</strong> button at the bottom. This opens a pop-up box.</li>
<li>Click your Bucket name in the left pane to display a list of your Objects. In this example, the Bucket only has two Objects names 'lake-public.jpg' and 'lake-private.jpg'.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="DreamObjects Permissions" class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_06.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click on an Object to view its permissions.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="DreamObjects Permissions" class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_07.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>You'll see a permissions toggle button. Clicking this changes the URL link to the Object. The example above shows a public URL. If you visit it, you'll see the image.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="DreamObjects Permissions" class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-08_panel_dho_permissions_08.png"/></dd>
</dl>
The example above shows a private URL. It is a long strand of random characters that is only valid for a temporary time period. You can set this period in the 'Expires' dropdown menu. You'll only be able to view this image if you're using this private URL. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Can I view my Objects in a private bucket?</h2>
<p>Yes. It does not matter if the Bucket's permissions are set to Public or Private, you will always be able to view your Objects when using the Object's correct URL. The correct URL depends on if the Object is set to public or private as shown above.</p>
<p>Public Objects have a simple URL, where private Objects have the longer URL with a unique timestamp.</p>
<h2>Does changing a Bucket's permissions in the panel change the permissions of Objects within it?</h2>
<p>No. Changing the Bucket's permissions in the panel does not change any of the Object's permissions. They will remain the same.</p>
