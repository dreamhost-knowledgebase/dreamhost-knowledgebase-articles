<h2>Method 3&nbsp;— Manually migrating your site</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can also manually migrate your site yourself. The following instructions&nbsp;describe how to migrate a WordPress installation between two domains hosted at DreamHost. The example domains used in these instructions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>oldsite.example.com<br /> and</li>
<li>newsite.example.com</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 1 – Back up your data</h3>
<p>You should always backup your data before making any change to your site. View the following article for instructions on how to backup your web site files, database, and any email you wish to keep:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Step 2 – Add hosting for the new site</h3>
<p>Add the new domain (newsite.example.com) to your panel. Make sure to set it as Fully Hosted:</p>

<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-" target="_self">Adding a Domain</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3 – Create a new database</h3>
<p>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.mysql" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL Databases</a> page and create a new MySQL hostname and empty database.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221691727-Creating-a-MySQL-database" target="_self">Create a new database</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 4 – Transfer your WordPress installation</h3>
<p>Transfer the WordPress files you’ve backed up in step one to your new domain. If you had email addresses on the old site (oldsite.example.com), make sure to create the same addresses on your new domain. You can then transfer those emails.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Transfer email from your old domain:

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 5 – Edit the new wp-config.php file</h3>
<p>Log into your new site (newsite.example.com) via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials" target="_self">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview" target="_self">SSH</a> and open the wp-config.php file (this is in your site's directory). You’ll see the following contents:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('DB_NAME', ‘exampledatabase’);
define('DB_USER', 'exampledbuser');
define('DB_PASSWORD', ‘database password here’);
define('DB_HOST', 'mysql.example.com');
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8');
define('DB_COLLATE', '');

$table_prefix = 'wp_2hdy121d_';</pre>
</div>
<p>Update the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Database name</li>
<li>Database user</li>
<li>Database user password</li>
<li>Hostname</li>
<li>Replace the existing WordPress $table_prefix value with the imported $table_prefix value.
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Open the database file you previously downloaded in a text editor to view the correct prefix of each table. The example below shows what you will see. In this example, the table prefix is wp_mwpp89_.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">--
-- Table structure for table `wp_mwpp89_comments`
--</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6 – Update all URLs in the database</h3>
<p>You must now update all URLs in the database since the database is using the old URL. View the following article for several options on how to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003304711-Changing-all-URLs-in-your-WordPress-database" target="_self">Changing all URLs in your WordPress database</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you update all URLs, the HOME and SITE URL will also be updated.</p>
<p>At this point, your website should load normally on the new domain name.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Once the above steps are complete, the new site looks exactly the same as it once appeared on your old domain name.</p>
