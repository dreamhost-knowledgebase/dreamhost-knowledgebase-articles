<p>When you create the first email address for a domain (that is configured to be hosted with DreamHost), the system will also set up hostnames for Webmail service.</p>

<p>After you add the first email address, it could take 4-6 hours for the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS to update</a>Â online. Only after the DNS updates will you be able to access webmail. Any additional addresses you add are immediately available.</p>

<p>Webmail is located at:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="command">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</span>
</pre>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>In the past, it was possible to log into webmail at https://atmail.example.com (where example.com is your website). Due to improvements with DreamHost's email infrastructure, you should no longer use this URL to connect.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that you only use <a href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a> to connect to your webmail account.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Webmail is automatically configured to connect to the DreamHost mail server. The only settings you must enter are a mail account username and password to log in.</p>
