<h2>What is a DreamHost WordPress install?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost WordPress installer allows you to quickly set up new WordPress installations in the DreamHost panel with minimal input. The DreamHost panel provides several features (such as the website renamer, automatic WordPress version updates, and easy DreamPress upgrades) to WordPress websites created by the DreamHost WordPress installer.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">

<h2>Before installing</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Configure hosting</h3>
<p>To use the DreamHost WordPress installer, your domain must first be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting">Fully Hosted</a>.</p>
<p>This means it cannot be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215909407#Redirect" target="_self">Redirected, Mirrored, Parked, or set as DNS Only</a>.</p>
<h3>Check the files in your website directory</h3>
<p>Before installing WordPress, check what files are already in your website's directory.</p>
<h4><strong>If there are existing WordPress files in the site directory</strong></h4>
<p>If there are any existing WordPress files, the installation will stop with the following message.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-wordpress-installer-03.png" alt="Install WordPress error" width="324" height="89" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You must remove any existing WordPress files from the website directory before installing.</p>
<h4><strong>If there are non-WordPress files in your directory</strong></h4>
<p>If there are any non-WordPress files or directories, these will not be touched by the installation. The new WordPress files will be installed alongside your existing files.</p>

<h2>Install Issues</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If the installation completes but you do not receive the email with the instructions on how to access your new WordPress install, you can always check your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001331583-Viewing-tickets-and-DreamHost-messages" target="_self">"Recent Messages" on the Contact Support page</a> for an archived copy of that email.</p>

<h3>Install link does not work</h3>
<p>A 404 or "Site Not Found" error can appear on new WordPress setups when you attempt to view the site after changing it over from another hosting option (such as mirroring or redirection). In these cases, the site is still resolving to the old Mirror or Redirection A records, rather than the new Fully Hosted A records. Fortunately, this will resolve once DNS propagation completes, assuming that the site is using DreamHostâ€™s nameservers. See the following article for further information on DNS propagation:</p>
