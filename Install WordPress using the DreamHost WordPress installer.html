<h2>What is a DreamHost WordPress install?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost WordPress installer allows you to quickly set up new WordPress installations in the DreamHost panel with minimal input. The DreamHost panel provides several features (such as the website renamer, automatic WordPress version updates, and easy DreamPress upgrades) to WordPress websites created by the DreamHost WordPress installer.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you would like to use DreamHost WordPress installer features with an existing WordPress install, please <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview" target="_self">contact support</a> to have your installation converted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Before installing</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>To use the DreamHost WordPress installer, your domain must first be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Fully Hosted</a>.</p>
<p>This means it can't be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215909407#Redirect" target="_self">Redirected, Mirrored, Parked, or set as DNS Only</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Before installing WordPress, check what files are already in your website's directory.</p>
<h3>If there are existing WordPress files</h3>
<p>If there are any existing WordPress files in it, they will be renamed with a string of numbers at the end. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">index.php.1353108851</span></li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to remove these files.</p>

</ul>
<h3>If there are non-WordPress files in your directory</h3>
<p>If there are any non-WordPress files or directories, these will not be touched by the installation. The new WordPress files will be installed alongside your existing files.</p>

<h2>The Deluxe Install</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The free Deluxe Install features several important customizations to make it easy for beginners to get started, including free and open source themes from Automattic, a standard selection of plugins, and a security enhancement.</p>
<h3><span id="Themes">Themes</span></h3>
<p>Deluxe Installs include the following selection of free and open source themes from Automattic:</p>
<ul>
<li>astra</li>
<li>blocksy</li>

<li>twentysixteen (also present in regular installs)</li>
<li>ultra</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Plugins">Plugins</span></h3>
<p>DreamHost's WordPress Install also includes the following popular plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">Akismet</a> (also present in regular installs) — Checks your comments and contact form submissions against Askimet's global database of spam to prevent your site from publishing malicious content.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All in One SEO</a> (AIOSEO) — Properly sets up WordPress SEO, so your websites can rank higher in search engines and uncover new growth opportunities in less than 10 minutes.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly</a> — When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <em>Hello, Dolly</em> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a> — Provides easy-to-use, comprehensive WordPress site security including auto real-time backups and easy restores, malware scanning, and spam protection.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/" target="_self" rel="undefined">WP Mail SMTP</a> — Fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215526937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">general configuration</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360029770912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gmail configuration</a> articles for more information.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> (automatically enabled by default) — Generates static HTML files from your dynamic WordPress blog; after an HTML file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/">WPForms Lite</a> (automatically enabled by default) — Allows you to quickly create beautiful contact forms, feedback forms, subscription forms, payment forms, and other types of forms for your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though these plugins are installed by default for Deluxe installations, you may need to activate them in your WordPress dashboard by going to ‘Plugins' &gt; 'Installed Plugins’.</p>
<h3><span id="Security_enhancement">Security enhancement</span></h3>
<p>Additionally, the DreamHost WordPress install adds protection against the execution of scripts within your uploads directory.</p>
<p>In more technical terms, this means a <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file with the following contents is automatically added to your <span class="text-object">/wp-content/uploads/</span> directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">### Generated by DreamHost. DO NOT modify!!! ###
SetHandler no-handler
################################################</pre>
</div>
<p>If your site is compromised through the placing of a malicious script in your uploads directory, the script is returned as a download when accessed. This keeps the script from running and helps to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>DreamHost will continue to add additional security enhancements as they become available.</p>
</div>
<h2>Install Issues</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If the installation completes but you do not receive the email with the instructions on how to access your new WordPress install, you can always check your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001331583-Viewing-tickets-and-DreamHost-messages" target="_self">"Recent Messages" on the Contact Support page</a> for an archived copy of that email.</p>

<h3>Install link does not work</h3>
<p>A 404 or "Site Not Found" error can appear on new WordPress setups when you attempt to view the site after changing it over from another hosting option (such as mirroring or redirection). In these cases, the site is still resolving to the old Mirror or Redirection A records, rather than the new Fully Hosted A records. Fortunately, this will resolve once DNS propagation completes, assuming that the site is using DreamHost’s nameservers. See the following article for further information on DNS propagation:</p>
