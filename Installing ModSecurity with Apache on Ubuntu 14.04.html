<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>ModSecurity is an open source web application firewall (WAF) designed as a module for Apache web servers. ModSecurity provides a flexible rule engine, allowing users to write (or use third-party) rules for protecting websites from attacks such as XSS, SQLi, CSRF, DDoS, and brute force login (as well as a number of other exploits). This tutorial walks through the basics of installing and configuring ModSecurity for an Apache web server. This tutorial assumes that <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215879457-How-to-Configure-Apache-on-DreamCompute-Running-Debian-or-Ubuntu">Apache is already installed</a> and running.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installing ModSecurity</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Log in and switch to your root user.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[user@instance]$ </span><span class="command">sudo su -</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Ensure that the system package sources are up to date:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">apt-get update</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Next, install ModSecurity:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">apt-get install libapache2-mod-security2</span></pre>
</div>
<p>This automatically installs and activates ModSecurity. In order to begin using ModSecurity, a usable configuration file must be put into place. The ModSecurity package provided for Ubuntu contains a default recommended config file that can be used as a starting point:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">mv /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended \
/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Once this is in place, reload Apache for the default ModSecurity config file to take effect:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">service apache2 reload</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Configuring ModSecurity</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The recommended default config file provided for ModSecurity has very few actual protective rules configured, but is a good starting point. In this tutorial the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) is used to provide additional protection.</p>
<h3>Enabling CRS Rulesets</h3>
<p>The Ubuntu package for ModSecurity recommends a separate package containing the CRS rulesets, which can be used as an extra source of rules for WAF. Configure&nbsp;ModSecurity to read rule files from the&nbsp;<span class="text-object">activated_rules</span>&nbsp;directory by adding&nbsp;the following directives to the&nbsp;<span class="text-object">/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security2.conf</span>&nbsp;file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">IncludeOptional "/usr/share/modsecurity-crs/*.conf"
IncludeOptional "/usr/share/modsecurity-crs/activated_rules/*.conf"</pre>
</div>
<p>This instructs ModSecurity to attempt to use any files ending in <span class="text-object">conf</span> as configuration files. More information is available in the README file in the <span class="text-object">activated_rules</span> directory.</p>
<p>Once this is done, link the desired rulesets into the newly included locations. For example, to add rules designed to protect against SQL injection attacks, link in the <span class="text-object">sql_injection_attacks</span> file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">cd /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/</span>
<span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">ln -s ./base_rules/modsecurity_crs_41_sql_injection_attacks.conf \
./activated_rules/</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Of course, it’s possible to link only certain rulesets, or entire groups, depending on your needs. The CRS is also distributed with custom and experimental rulesets to detect and mitigate a wide variety of emerging threats. Rulesets for specific CMS/application installations, such as WordPress and Joomla, are also available in the <span class="text-object">slr_rules</span> directory (though as a free WAF ruleset offering, these rulesets are not always current with the latest threats).</p>
<p>Any time the ModSecurity configuration is adjusted, Apache must be reloaded in order for the rules to take effect:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">service apache2 reload</span></pre>
</div>
<h3>Activating ModSecurity</h3>
<p>ModSecurity initially runs in <cite>DetectionOnly</cite> mode, in which the WAF examines HTTP(S) traffic, but does not actually block malicious requests. This must be adjusted in order for ModSecurity to deny attack traffic. In the file <span class="text-object">/etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf</span>, find the directive <span class="code">SecRuleEngine</span>:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly</pre>
</div>
<p>And set its value to <cite>On</cite>:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">SecRuleEngine On</pre>
</div>
<p>And of course, reload Apache to effect the changes:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[root@instance]# </span><span class="command">service apache2 restart</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Further Configuration</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>WAF environments can be complex and time-consuming to tune and adjust based on your instance's needs which is largely why the CRS was created. If you need to write or change custom rules, it’s recommended to read though the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual">ModSecurity reference manual</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <cite>modsecurity-users</cite> mailing list and <cite>#modsecurity</cite> room on Freenode IRC are excellent resources for experienced ModSecurity users and developers.</p>
