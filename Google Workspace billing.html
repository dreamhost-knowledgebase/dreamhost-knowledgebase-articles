<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost's Google Workspace plans are billed monthly based on the type of plan and number of users. To view pricing and available plan and user options, visit the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=mail.workspace#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Workspace</a> page in the DreamHost Panel.</p>

<h2>Free trial</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When adding a new Google Workspace to a DreamHost domain, you are eligible for a 30-day free trial.</p>
<p>After the free trial period, you are not immediately billed for Google Workspace. The charge is added to your regular monthly bill and due at the next due date (rebill date).</p>
<p>At any point during the free trial, you may cancel the service or upgrade the number of users. Upon the completion of the trial, you will automatically transition onto monthly billing.</p>
</div>
<h2>Users</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You may make adjustments to the number of users in your Google Workspace account at any time. To adjust the number of users, you must make changes in both your Google Workspace admin console (which manages the users themselves) as well as your DreamHost panel (which manages how those users are billed).</p>
<h3>Adding users</h3>
<p>To add a new user to your Google Workspace account, you must first purchase them in the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=mail.workspace#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Workspace</a> page of your DreamHost panel. Once your number of users has been upgraded, you can then create the accounts in your Google Workspace admin console.</p>
<p>You will not be able to add more users in the Google Workspace admin console than the number purchased in the DreamHost control panel.</p>
<p>Additional users purchased mid-month are prorated on a daily basis.</p>
<h3>Removing users</h3>
<p>When downgrading the number of users on a plan, you must first delete any users you no longer wish to use from your Google Workspace admin console. In order to adjust the number of users you are being billed for, you must then make this change in the DreamHost Panel.</p>
<p>Users removed mid-month will be credited on a prorated daily basis.</p>
<p>If you do not want to be billed for unused seats, you must decrease the number of users in the DreamHost control panel.</p>
</div>
<h2>Non-payment and suspension</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your DreamHost account must remain in good standing in order to use Google Workspace. Any Google Workspace charges must be paid within 7 days of their initial charge or your Google Workspace account will be suspended.</p>
<p>Google Workspace will be re-enabled after a due balance is paid. However, if your account remains suspended for <strong>60 days</strong>, it will be automatically canceled by Google.</p>
