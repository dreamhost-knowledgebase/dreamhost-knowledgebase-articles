<p>When your monthly billing statement comes to a close, DreamHost provides you with an automatic 60-day grace period to pay the balance due in full. If the balance is not paid within 60 days, the account is automatically suspended and services are taken offline. However, DreamHost support is able to offer you a payment extension if you need it.</p>
<h2><span id="When_does_my_balance_need_to_be_paid.3F">When does my balance need to be paid?</span></h2>
<p>The DreamHost billing system operates on a monthly invoicing schedule and the end of your billing period is determined by the date when you originally opened the account. Ideally, due balances on invoices should be paid as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, DreamHost provides a 60-day grace period from the closing date of the invoice for these payments to be made. This grace period is set automatically in the system, and you will continue to receive billing reminder notices until the balance has been paid or the account has been suspended.</p>

<p>The image below is a sample of billing due dates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your original Due Date is the end date on your monthly invoice.</li>
<li>If your balance is not paid 30 days later, your account is considered Past Due.</li>
<li>After another 30 days (60 days after your original invoicing date), your account is considered delinquent (if it is unpaid) and will be suspended.</li>
</ul>
