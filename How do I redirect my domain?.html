<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A "redirect" domain acts as a pointer to another domain. When accessing a web page on the redirected domain, the browser's URL is changed to the domain to which it is being redirected. When setting this up through the DreamHost panel, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection">301</a> redirect is created automatically.</p>
<p>This article explains how to redirect a domain or subdomain at DreamHost.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>The examples in this article use the HTTPS protocol. For this to work, the domain you're redirecting to must already <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">have an SSL certificate configured</a>. If not, just use HTTP instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>How does the redirect work?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Any page you visit on your current site (the one being redirected) is forwarded to the page on the redirected site. For example, let's say you're redirecting <strong>example.com</strong> to <strong>dreamhost.com</strong>. If you visit <strong>example.com/contact.html</strong>, the URL changes to <strong>dreamhost.com/contact.html</strong>.</p>
<h2>Does redirecting work for the www and non-www version of the site?</h2>
<p>Yes. If you set up a redirect on <strong>example.com</strong>, it also will work for <strong>www.example.com</strong>.</p>
<h2><span id="redirect_to_https">Does redirecting work with https (SSL certificate)?</span></h2>
<p>The following describes a few different ways this could be configured.</p>
<h3>Option 1 — Redirecting to the secure version of a different site</h3>
<p>You can only redirect to another site that's already configured with an SSL certificate. For example:</p>
<p><strong>http://example.com </strong>to<strong> https://dreamhostexample.com</strong></p>
<h3>Option 2 — Redirecting to the secure version of the same site</h3>
<p>It's not possible to use the panel's Redirect option (described below) to redirect to HTTPS as this removes hosting from the domain. For example:</p>
<p><strong>http://example.com </strong>to<strong> https://example.com</strong></p>
<p>This is also not necessary since after you have&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">added an SSL certificate</a>&nbsp;to your domain,&nbsp;DreamHost automatically redirects the URL visitors use to view your site from HTTP to HTTPS. The 'S' ensures that your connection is encrypted. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https</strong>://example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>There's nothing on your end you must do in order to force your site to use the secure URL. However, in some special cases, it may be necessary for you to&nbsp;create your own custom configuration file to force the redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>Adding custom code is only necessary if your website requires specific code to force the redirect</strong>. If so, you will need to first disable the automatic redirect in your panel.</p>

</ul>
<p>Once disabled, you can then proceed with <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003505112-How-to-force-your-site-to-redirect-to-https-SSL-" target="_self">adding your custom redirect file</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating a redirect to a subdirectory</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you need to create a redirect to a subdirectory of another site, make sure to add a trailing forward slash to the redirected URL. If you do not, the URL will not redirect correctly.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border solvvy-hidden" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-08_panel_domains_redirect_02.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, if your site is 'example.com' and you want to redirect to a subdirectory of another site called 'dreamhostexample.com/blog', make sure the redirect you create adds the trailing forward slash like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dreamhostexample.com/blog/</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not add the forward slash, any files accessed within that subdirectory will not load since the URL will be incorrect.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You cannot redirect to a subdirectory of the same website.</p>

<h2>Turning off a Redirect</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To turn off a Redirect, you must change the hosting configuration to any other option such as 'Fully Hosted' or 'DNS Only'. View the following articles for instructions:</p>

<h2>How long until the redirect is working?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Redirecting your site is the same as any other DNS change. This means the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> first before you can see the changes online. In general, this shouldn't take any longer than 6 hours. You can keep track of when the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">new DNS records</a> update in different locations at this site.</p>
