<li>If you have a balance due immediately or are nearing account suspension, it is recommended that you use a credit card or PayPal for quicker service.</li>
<li>If your account has a service balance that's 30 days past due, the web panel will become restricted until the balance is resolved.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Depending on your payment method, it may take various lengths of time to process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card payments post almost instantly.</li>
<li>If you are using PayPal to make a payment, it may take some time for PayPal to approve and post a payment to your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Electronic checks, mailed checks, or money order payments can take several weeks to process. DreamHost only accept checks or money orders drawn on U.S. banks and denominated in US Dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a payment clears, it is applied to your account and DreamHost will send you a receipt for the payment to your account profile's email address. Bank statements show the charge as coming from ‘DreamHost - DH-FEE.com’.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are purchasing any items that require payment up front (such as a new domain registration or renewal), payment must be made via credit card only. This is because the payment is applied immediately and then the request is sent right away to the registry on your behalf. You can also make a pre-payment with PayPal by following the instructions at:</p>
