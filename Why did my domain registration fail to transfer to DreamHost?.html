<h2>Domain is locked at current registrar, or is not yet 60 days old</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<li>Your domain status is set to "locked" at your current registrar.</li>
<li>You have made a change to the WHOIS information within the last 60 days (such as the contact information or email address). Per a recent policy change, ICANN prevents a transfer by locking the domain for 60 days from the date any WHOIS changes are made.</li>
