<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215912848-How-to-launch-an-instance-using-the-DreamCompute-dashboard">create an instance</a>, a default username is created. You can use this to log in and configure the instance.</p>
<p>If you're adding websites to your instance, it's recommended to create separate users for each site to further secure each one. For example, having a user who only has access to the one website will limit the havoc that could be caused should that user become compromised. This also limits the danger that could be caused by rogue plugins or themes. The instance itself will be safe, containing the damage just to that user account.</p>
<h2>Creating a new user</h2>
<ol>
<li>Log into your instance using the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216201547-Connect-to-your-instance-with-SSH-keys-overview">Key Pair assigned to it</a>Â and the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/228377408-How-to-find-the-default-user-of-an-image">default user assigned to it</a>.</li>
<li>Once logged in, create the new user.

<div class="alert-content">
<p>This example assumes an Ubuntu instance with a default user named 'ubuntu'.</p>
<p>In the example below, the new user is named 'newuser'.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">ubuntu@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">sudo adduser newuser</span>
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>You are prompted for a password along with additional details about the user.</li>
<li>You can now check to confirm the user exists.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">ubuntu@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">ls -la /home</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Switch to the new user.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">ubuntu@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">sudo su newuser</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Your terminal prompt now changes to the new username.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">newuser@instance:~$ </span></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now run commands and manage your website under this new username.</p>
<h2>Assign the new user 'sudo' privileges</h2>
<p>Depending on your user's needs, you may need to assign them 'sudo' privileges to install software. This should only be done if you trust the user.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you're logged in as the default user of your instance. For an Ubuntu instance, the default user is 'ubuntu'. If you're still logged in as the new user, just type 'exit' until the shell username returns to the default user:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">newuser@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">exit</span>
<span class="server">ubuntu@instance:~$ </span>
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Run the following command to give your new user sudo privileges:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">ubuntu@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">sudo usermod -aG sudo newuser</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>To confirm the new privileges, switch to the new user.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">ubuntu@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">sudo su newuser</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Run the 'groups' command to see what groups this user has access to:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">newuser@instance:~$ </span><span class="command">groups</span>
newuser sudo</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Since 'sudo' is in the list, you can now run sudo commands with this new username.</li>
</ol>
