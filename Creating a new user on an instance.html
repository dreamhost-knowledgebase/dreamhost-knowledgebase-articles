<p>When you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215912848-How-to-launch-an-instance-using-the-DreamCompute-dashboard">create an instance</a>, a default username is created. You can use this to log in and configure the instance.</p>
<p>If you're adding websites to your instance, it's recommended to create separate users for each site to further secure each one. For example, having a user who only has access to the one website will limit the havoc that could be caused should that user become compromised. This also limits the danger that could be caused by rogue plugins or themes. The instance itself will be safe, containing the damage just to that user account.</p>
<h2>Creating a new user</h2>
<ol>
<li>Log into your instance using the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216201547-Connect-to-your-instance-with-SSH-keys-overview">Key Pair assigned to it</a>Â and the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/228377408-How-to-find-the-default-user-of-an-image">default user assigned to it</a>.</li>
<li>Once logged in, create the new user.

<p>This example assumes an Ubuntu instance with a default user named 'ubuntu'.</p>
<p>In the example below, the new user is named 'myuser'.</p>

</div>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[ubuntu@instance]$ </span><span class="command">sudo adduser myuser</span>
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>You are prompted for a password along with additional details about the user.</li>
<li>You can now check to confirm the user exists.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[ubuntu@instance]$ </span><span class="command">ls -la /home</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Switch to the new user.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[ubuntu@instance]$ </span><span class="command">sudo su myuser</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Your terminal prompt now changes to the new username.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[myuser@instance]$ </span></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now run commands and manage your website under this new username.</p>
