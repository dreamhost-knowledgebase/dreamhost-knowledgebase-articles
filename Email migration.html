<p>In an effort to improve email services, DreamHost has created a new mail server and is currently migrating existing customers to it. This will ultimately help to stabilize and improve email services for all customers.</p>
<p>SSL connections are also enabled by default ensuring your connecting to the server is safe and secure.</p>

<p>Please note that due to the email server upgrades, Vanity mail servers will no longer be supported. <a href="#vanity_mail_server">View the section below</a> for further details.</p>

<h2>What to expect</h2>
<h3>Duplicate emails during the migration process</h3>
<p>This could potentially happen if any email is set as 'READ'. It could also happen to emails that were read, but then marked as 'UNREAD'.</p>
<h3>DNS propagation issues</h3>
<p>It's possible that you may notice some email delays during the migration period. It's possibly this could result in missing email as some email could potentially be routed to the old server during the DNS propagation period. However, it will eventually be copied to the new server.</p>
<h2>How to prepare</h2>
<h3>Updating your email client configuration</h3>
<p>If you have been migrated to the mail server, your Email client configuration may need to be updated.</p>
<h4><strong>New mail servers</strong></h4>
<p>In the past, your email servername (hostname) would have looked like 'sub4.mail.dreamhost.com'. This address will still continue to work and these easier-to-remember names will also work:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><strong>IMAP (most common)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>imap.dreamhost.com — Port 993 (incoming IMAP connections)</li>
<li>smtp.dreamhost.com — Port 465 (outgoing SMTP connections)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>POP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pop.dreamhost.com — Port 995 (incoming POP connections)</li>
<li>smtp.dreamhost.com — Port 465 (outgoing SMTP connections)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><strong>Webmail server</strong></h4>
<p>You can log into your webmail at the following address:</p>
<ul>
<li>webmail.dreamhost.com</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if I'm using external DNS?</h3>
<p>If you are using an external DNS provider, DNS may need to update (including MX records).</p>
<h4><strong>MX servers</strong></h4>
<p>The following are the new MX servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>mx1.dreamhost.com</li>
<li>mx2.dreamhost.com</li>
<li>mx3.dreamhost.com</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vanity_mail_server">Vanity Mail Server EOL</span></h2>
<p>After your email service is migrated to the new server, DreamHost will no longer support the use of <strong>mail.yourdomain.com</strong> or <strong>webmail.yourdomain.com</strong>. <strong>webmail.yourdomain.com</strong> will continue to work, but eventually it will stop.</p>
<p>It's highly recommended that you only use <strong>webmail.dreamhost.com</strong> going forward. This will help to fix the issue of receiving a 'mismatch' error in your browser when visiting:</p>
