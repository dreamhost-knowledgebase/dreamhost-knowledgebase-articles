<p>In an effort to improve <span style="font-weight: 400;">the speed and reliability of your </span>email service, DreamHost <span style="font-weight: 400;">is upgrading customer email accounts to new, faster hardware in its state-of-the-art data center</span>. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To boost the safety and security of your email, SSL is now enabled by default for connections to DreamHost’s mail servers.</span></p>

<h2>What to expect</h2>
<h3>Duplicate emails during the migration process</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll continue to have access to your email accounts during migration, but please refrain from making any changes within your accounts until maintenance wraps up. Moving emails between folders, deleting messages, and even modifying “message-read” flags may cause those messages to duplicate at the new location during the cleanup synchronization. Rest assured, you will not lose any emails as a result of this migration.</span></p>
<h3>DNS propagation issues</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incoming messages may be delayed as the new servers’ DNS records propagate across the Internet. Some messages may even </span><em>temporarily</em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appear to go missing on the new server. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t panic if this happens—they will return!</span></p>
<h3>Catch-all End of Life</h3>
<p>If you have created a catch-all email address, this functionality will no longer work once the migration has completed.</p>
<p>To ensure you do not miss any incoming emails, make sure you create any addresses you wish to receive email at. For example:</p>
<p>admin@example.com<br />contact@example.com</p>
<p>Do this prior to the migration so these addresses will continue to receive incoming email. Please view the article below for instructions on how to add an email address:</p>

</ul>
<h2>How to prepare</h2>
<h3>Updating your email client configuration</h3>
<p>If you have been migrated to the mail server, your email client configuration may need to be updated.</p>
<h4><strong>New mail servers</strong></h4>
<p>In the past, your email servername (hostname) would have looked like 'sub4.mail.dreamhost.com'. Although this address will continue to work, DreamHost<span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommends you update your mail client settings with these new, simplified server URLs:</span></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><strong>IMAP (most common)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>imap.dreamhost.com — Port 993 (incoming IMAP connections)</li>
<li>smtp.dreamhost.com — Port 465 (outgoing SMTP connections)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>POP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>pop.dreamhost.com — Port 995 (incoming POP connections)</li>
<li>smtp.dreamhost.com — Port 465 (outgoing SMTP connections)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h4><strong>Webmail server</strong></h4>
<p>You can log into your webmail at the following address:</p>
<ul>
<li>webmail.dreamhost.com</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if I'm using external DNS?</h3>
<p>If you are using an external DNS provider, <span style="font-weight: 400;">its records may need to be updated as well</span> (including MX records).</p>
<h4><strong>MX servers</strong></h4>
<p>The following are the new MX servers:</p>
<ul>
<li>mx1.dreamhost.com</li>
<li>mx2.dreamhost.com</li>
<li>mx3.dreamhost.com</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="vanity_mail_server">Vanity mail server EOL</span></h2>
<p>After your email service is migrated to the new server, DreamHost will no longer support the use of <span style="font-weight: 400;">‘vanity’ mail server URLs, such as</span> <strong>mail.example.com</strong> or <strong>webmail.example.com</strong>. You may notice that <strong>webmail.example.com</strong> will continue to function for a limited time, but eventually it will stop.</p>
<p>Therefore, DreamHost strongly recommends that you use <strong>webmail.dreamhost.com</strong> going forward. This will <span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent your browser from displaying an ‘SSL certificate name mismatch’ error while logging into webmail. You can read more about this error in the following article:</span></p>
