<h2>What happens to my Domain Registration(s) when I close my account?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost will not delete your domain registrations when you close your account. Any domain registrations previously purchased continue to remain active for the rest of their registration periods. When you close your account, DreamHost gives you the option to keep your panel open so you can continue to manage your Domain Registrations.</p>
