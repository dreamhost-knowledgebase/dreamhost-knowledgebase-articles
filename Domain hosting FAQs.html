<h2>How many domains can I host?</h2>
<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared</a>, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> and <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> hosting plans have no limit on the number of domains you can host. The only service that’s limited to a single domain is <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> hosting. That is because DreamPress is a dedicated service catered to a single WordPress site.</p>
<h2>Can I host a subdomain only?</h2>
<p>Yes. Simply add the primary domain in the panel, then the subdomain. You’ll then be able to view the IP address for the subdomain. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Adding a domain</a> article for details.</p>
<h2>Can I host an OpenNIC TLD (e.g., Namecoin, Emercoin, New Nations, and so on) at DreamHost?</h2>
<p>DreamHost's managed hosting system is not configured to support OpenNIC TLDs. You can, however, configure a <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/">DreamCompute</a> instance for this purpose. Unfortunately, support is not available for this due to the high level of customization that's required. See the following for more information:</p>

<h2 class="header-section">Accessing</h2>
<h2>How can I upload and access my domain files?</h2>
<p>Using a client, you can access the server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>. You can also use a terminal to access it via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. More information can be found in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214694298-What-are-the-different-types-of-DreamHost-users-">Users</a> article.</p>
<h2>How do I view and access my domain if the DNS is not yet pointed to DreamHost?</h2>
<p>You have a few options. Please visit the guide on <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Previewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">previewing your site before the DNS change using a dreamhosters.com subdomain.</a></p>
<h2>Can I access the domain using an IP address?</h2>
<p>The only way this is possible is if you purchase a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a>. Then your site will have a specific IP assigned. Otherwise, this is not possible.</p>
<h2 class="header-section">General</h2>
<h2>I fully-hosted my domain. Where is the public_html?</h2>
<p>When <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">adding hosting to fully host your domain</a>, you are prompted to enter a web directory. This directory is where you place the content on your web server. Drop in your index file in the web directory so it displays when you visit your page. This web directory is the same as your “public_html” folder. Visit the Adding Domains &amp; Subdomains article for details.</p>
<h2>I added a domain to the panel as Fully Hosted and the nameservers are already pointed to DreamHost. How long until I can access my site?</h2>
