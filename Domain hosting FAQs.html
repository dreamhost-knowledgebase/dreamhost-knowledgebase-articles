<h2>How many domains can I host?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared</a>, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>, and <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> Hosting plans have no limit on the number of domains you can host. The only service that’s limited to a single domain is <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437#Shared_Starter" target="_self">Shared Starter</a> Hosting. That is because DreamPress is a dedicated service catered to a single WordPress site.</p>

<h2>How much is hosting?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>View the following link for current hosting prices:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/">dreamhost.com/hosting/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Can I host a subdomain only?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes. Simply add the primary domain in the panel, then the subdomain. You’ll then be able to view the IP address for the subdomain. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Adding a domain</a> article for details.</p>

<h2>Can I host an OpenNIC TLD (e.g., Namecoin, Emercoin, New Nations, and so on) at DreamHost?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost's managed hosting system is not configured to support OpenNIC TLDs. You can, however, configure a <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/">DreamCompute</a> instance for this purpose. Unfortunately, support is not available for this due to the high level of customization that's required. See the following for more information:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Can I restore my site if I accidentally remove hosting from the domain?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Maybe. If your site was hosted on a Shared Server, VPS, or Dedicated Server, the site files are not automatically deleted when the domain is removed. If you set the domain to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Fully Hosted</a> again, you can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214920778-Where-do-I-upload-my-files-once-connected-via-FTP-">point it to the previous FTP user and directory</a> to restore the site.</p>
<p>DreamPress servers are automatically deleted when the domain is removed from DreamPress, and their data cannot be restored once the server is deleted.</p>

<h2 class="header-section">Accessing</h2>
<h2>How can I upload and access my domain files?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Using a client, you can access the server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>.

More information can be found in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214694298-What-are-the-different-types-of-DreamHost-users-">Users</a>&nbsp;article.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I view and access my domain if the DNS is not yet pointed to DreamHost?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You have a few options. Please visit the guide on <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Previewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">previewing your site before the DNS change using a dreamhosters.com subdomain.</a></p>
</div>
<h2>Can I access the domain using an IP address?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The only way this is possible is if you purchase a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a>. Then your site will have a specific IP assigned. Otherwise, this is not possible.</p>

<h2 class="header-section">General</h2>
<h2><span id="public_html">I fully-hosted my domain. Where is the public_html?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-" target="_self" rel="undefined">adding hosting to your domain</a>, you are prompted to enter a web directory. This directory is where you place your website files on your web server. Upload your index file in the web directory named after your site (<strong>/example.com</strong>) so it displays when you visit your page.</p>
<p>Other hosts reference this as the <span class="text-object">public_html</span> directory. It functions the same way at DreamHost.

<h2>I added a domain to the panel as Fully Hosted and the nameservers are already pointed to DreamHost. How long until I can access my site?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you recently <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">added hosting to the domain</a>, it can take anywhere from 4-8 hrs to resolve online. You can use either of the following links to check on the DNS propagation status:</p>

<h2>Is DreamHost HIPAA compliant?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost is not HIPAA compliant and is therefore unable to issue a BAA (Business Associate Agreement).</p>
<p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was created to establish national standards on how medical records are protected. More specifically, the 'Security Rule' specifies standards to protect electronically transferred health information. The Security Rule requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information.
