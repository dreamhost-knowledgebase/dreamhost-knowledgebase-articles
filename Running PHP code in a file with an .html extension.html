<p>Normally, when PHP and HTML are combined in the same file, the file uses a .php extension and displays data in the browser.</p>
<p>However, if you need to place PHP code in a file with an .html extension, you must add a Handler to your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file.</p>

<p>The file you need to add code to is named <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span>.

<p><strong>If your site is on a server running Ubuntu 18</strong></p>
<p>You can add either of the following.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">AddHandler php-cgi .html<br />AddHandler php5-cgi .html</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>If your site is on a server running Ubuntu 14</strong></p>
<p>Only the following will work.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">AddHandler php5-cgi .html</pre>
</div>
<p>This line of code allows files with .html extensions to run PHP code in your browser.</p>
