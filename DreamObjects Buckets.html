<h2 id="h_01HQJYDX27QS5DCRTAMMTZ6JBW">Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A Bucket is a mechanism for grouping objects in DreamObjects, similar to a folder. Unlike a folder, Buckets exist in a global namespace inside DreamObjects, which means that bucket names must be unique, just like a domain name, since they are used to create public URLs to store objects.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQJYDX27ZFY3JYA3ZHGP363A">Creating a Bucket</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p class="first">Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamObjects</a> page in your DreamHost panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Click the <span class="text-object">Manage</span> tab at the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Under your username, click the <strong>Add Bucket</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Enter a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115001494772-DreamObjects-Bucket-Names">name</a> for your bucket in the Bucket Name field box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Click the <strong>Add Bucket</strong> button.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Bucket names must include at least 3 characters and can only contain lowercase characters (a–z), numbers (0–9), hyphens (-), and dots (only a single dot at a time, and cannot end in a dot). Though certain symbols such as dashes or dots are valid, they <strong>will</strong> break DNS on your bucket name (reducing the bucket’s functionality) and are not recommended.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQJYDX27CZP9ASB9T01RBFEP">Setting bucket permissions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can set your new bucket to have public or private permissions. View the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000677011-DreamObjects-permissions">DreamObjects permissions</a>' article for details. To select a permission setting, you must edit the bucket:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p class="first">Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamObjects</a> page in your DreamHost panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Click the <span class="text-link">Change Settings</span> link to the right of your bucket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Select a permissions setting for the contents of your bucket by clicking the 'Permissions' toggle button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose either Private or Public.</li>
<li>You can change the permission setting at anytime after creating the bucket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Public means that it is possible to view the Bucket properties and a list of the contents of the bucket by navigating to the Bucket URL. Although you will be able to see that an object is listed as part of the contents of a Bucket, the actual Object cannot be read unless it has also been marked Public.</p>
<p>Object permissions default to private. If you need to update all object permissions in a bucket, use the following Python script:</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQJYDX2733TMCR2T8K8VQGSD">Editing a Bucket</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Options for editing a Bucket are limited, but you can:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Modify the permission settings on an existing Bucket at any time.</li>
<li>Add or remove contents from a Bucket.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>It is not possible to directly change a bucket name or transfer the bucket to another DreamHost customer. However you can migrate the contents of an existing bucket to a new bucket that is owned by any of your DreamObjects users. For more information on this method, see the following article:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQJYDX27AF5QZXT7BG1APZXR">Deleting a Bucket</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>It is not possible to delete a bucket that contains any objects. Additionally, the bucket deletion operation is non-reversible. <strong>MAKE SURE</strong> sure you have backed up all data in the bucket before deleting it.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000059232-DreamObjects-clients" target="_self">DreamObjects client</a> to delete all bucket contents (recommended)</li>
<li>or you can use this <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022654971#deleting" target="_self">AWS CLI command</a> to delete all bucket contents via SSH (advanced)</li>
