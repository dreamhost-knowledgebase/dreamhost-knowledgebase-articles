<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost provides Shared (Shared Starter and Shared Unlimited) and DreamPress customers on annual plans with one free domain registration credit for the first year.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you are closing and have used a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-" target="_self">domain registration</a> credit in the last year, the panel will ask you to pay for it before closing. This allows you to close the account while retaining control over your domain.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249678#How_can_I_set_up_auto-renewal" target="_self">if the domain is set to expire in the panel</a>, and the registration is within 30 days of expiring, you will NOT be billed for it.</p>
</div>
<p>This article shows how to close/cancel an account with a Shared hosting plan and free domain registration. If your DreamHost account has VPS services and/or Dedicated services without a Shared hosting plan, refer instead to the links in the <a class="reference internal" href="#see_also">See also</a> section&nbsp;below.</p>

<p>The domain registration is only free for the first year if you purchased a Shared (Shared Starter and Shared Unlimited) or DreamPress annual plan. If that annual plan is canceled in the first year, you must then pay for the domain registration which is yours to own. View the following article for further details.</p>
