<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost provides Shared (Shared Starter and Shared Unlimited) and DreamPress customers on annual plans with one free domain registration credit for the first year.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you are closing and have used a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-" target="_self">domain registration</a> credit in the last year, the panel will ask you to pay for it before closing. This allows you to close the account while retaining control over your domain.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249678#How_can_I_set_up_auto-renewal" target="_self">if the domain is set to expire in the panel</a>, and the registration is within 30 days of expiring, you will NOT be billed for it.</p>
