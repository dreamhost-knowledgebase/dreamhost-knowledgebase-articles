<p>DreamHost provides&nbsp;Shared (Starter Shared and Unlimited Shared/Happy Hosting) and DreamPress customers on annual&nbsp;plans with one free domain registration credit for the first year.</p>
<p>When closing your account within the first year, the panel will ask you to pay for your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-" target="_self">free domain registration</a>. This allows you to close all services while retaining access to manage your domain registration.</p>
<p>This article shows how to close an account with a Shared hosting plan and free domain registration. If your DreamHost account has VPS services and/or Dedicated services without a Shared hosting plan, refer instead to the links in the <a class="reference internal" href="#see_also">'See also'</a> section&nbsp;below.</p>
