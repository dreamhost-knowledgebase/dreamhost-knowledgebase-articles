<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you enable Cloudflare in your DreamHost panel, you have the choice between two types of subscriptions:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Cloudflare Basic (free)</strong></dt>
<dd>All Cloudflare-enabled domains have access to the free Basic Cloudflare subscription at no cost.</dd>
<dt><strong>Cloudflare Plus</strong></dt>
<dd>The Cloudflare Plus subscription provides additional features such as image compression.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Cloudflare subscriptions are purchased from and managed inside your DreamHost panel, and the one you choose controls which features are available for a Cloudflare-enabled domain. Some features require use of the Cloudflare dashboard.</p>
<p>For more information on Cloudflare and how to enable it, please see the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215873088-Cloudflare-overview">Cloudflare overview</a> article.</p>
</div>
<h2>How Cloudflare subscriptions work</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Any subscription you enable for a domain, along with all of the Cloudflare features for that plan, are available to ALL of its subdomains at no extra charge. Please note, however, that you must specifically enable Cloudflare on each subdomain.</p>
<p>To explain, a single subscription covers both <strong>example.com</strong> and any subdomains, such as <strong>blog.example.com</strong>. However, a different domain like <strong>dreamhostexample.com</strong> requires a separate Cloudflare subscription. You may enable Cloudflare for an unlimited number of subdomains.</p>
<p>You do not need to add 'www' to your subdomain. For example, if your subdomain is <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, you can just activate Cloudflare for <strong>blog.example.com</strong>.</p>

<h2>Enabling Cloudflare subscriptions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215873088-Cloudflare-overview">Cloudflare</a> article for instructions on how to enable this service on your domain. When you add a service, you’ll see the two subscription options which are described below.</p>
<h3>Cloudflare Basic (FREE)</h3>
<p>Cloudflare Basic includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global CDN with multiple points presences around the world</li>
<li>Front-end web content optimization using RockLoader and AutoMinify</li>
<li>Broad security</li>
<li>SSL support</li>
<li>IPv6 compatibility</li>
<li>Site analytics (24-hour delay)</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you currently have the Plus option for SSL support and no longer want it, you can switch to Basic by canceling the Plus option and then switching to the free option instead. In order to facilitate the switch to the Basic option, you must enable the 'Add WWW' option in the DreamHost panel in order to complete the process. For more information about adding 'www' to your domain, please visit the following article:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3>Cloudflare Plus</h3>
<p>In addition to all the benefits of the Free service, the Cloudflare Plus plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster website performance and advanced imaged optimization (better mobile performance) through access to Cloudflare’s Polish, Mirage, and Lazy Loading features</li>
<li>10 URL rules</li>
<li>Site analytics (1-hour delay)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comparing plans</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>DreamHost subscriptions vs. Cloudflare subscriptions</h3>
<p>As hosting partners with Cloudflare, DreamHost’s Cloudflare subscriptions provide you with many of the same benefits of using Cloudflare’s services directly inside your DreamHost panel. You don’t need to change your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare’s to get these benefits.</p>
<h3>Cloudflare’s “Free” plan vs. DreamHost’s “Basic (free!)” plan</h3>
<p>There is no difference between the two.</p>
<h3>Cloudflare’s “Pro” plan vs. DreamHost’s “Plus” plan</h3>
<p>Cloudflare also offers a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/">“Pro” plan</a> with a few extra features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Application Firewall. DreamHost's Plus plan does not have the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a>. However, all shared, VPS, and DreamPress accounts <em>do</em> include the WAF installed on the Linux web server.</li>
<li>Cloudflare's Pro plan has 20 vs. 10 (DreamHost Plus plan) PageRules.</li>
</ul>
