<h2><span id="Sender_domain_policy">Sender domain policy</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you’ve created a PHP mail form and find it’s not sending email, then it’s most often due to the FROM address the form is using in its headers.</p>
<p>A simple way to confirm if this is the case:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your web server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <span class="text-object">/Maildir/new</span> folder which is located in your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">user’s directory</a>:
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/<span class="code-highlight">username</span>/Maildir/new</pre>
</div>
</dd>
<dd><em>In this directory, you’ll see emails that have failed to send.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Open the emails in a text editor.
<dl>
<dd><em>You may see the following error:</em></dd>
<dd>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Sender domain not allowed. Please read: https://dhurl.org/20b (in reply to end of DATA command))</pre>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Why does this happen?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This happens because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The outgoing spam prevention policies that were put into effect, as detailed <a href="https://dhurl.org/20b">here</a>.</li>
<li>The FROM address you’re using is not an email address on the domain you’re sending from and/or it’s not hosted with DreamHost.</li>
<li>For example, if you’re sending from a site called <strong>example.com</strong>, the FROM address in your PHP Mail form must be something like <span class="text-object">admin@example.com</span>. Changing this to your email hosted with DreamHost allows the form to send correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If DreamHost is not hosting your email, you must use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216140597-Send-PHP-mail-via-SMTP">SMTP authentication</a> to send in your PHP mail form. If you enable SMTP authentication, you can use any email address you like as the FROM address.</p>
<h3>Email messages aren't being sent on shared servers</h3>
<p>If you've verified that you've configured your domain properly to follow Sender Domain Policy, but email messages still aren't being sent from a shared server, it's possible that the server has reached its hourly sending limit. To avoid this, make sure your site is configured to use SMTP for sending:</p>

<li><strong>WordPress:</strong> <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215526937-Configuring-the-WP-Mail-SMTP-plugin" target="_self">WP Mail SMTP</a></li>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>In the past, it was possible to use <strong>mail.example.com</strong> to connect (where <strong>example.com</strong> is your actual domain name). Due to how modern mail clients handle security, this is now NOT recommended as it may throw connection errors. Please ensure you are only using your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">mail server name</a> when connecting. This should either be <strong>imap.dreamhost.com</strong> or <strong>pop.dreamhost.com</strong>.</p>

<h3><span id="Solution">Solution</span></h3>
<p>This is due to the hostname being used. The certificate references mail.dreamhost.com which is not same as your domain. View the following article for an explanation of this error:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215306748-Certificate-domain-mismatch-error-when-connecting-to-a-DreamHost-mail-server">Certificate Domain Mismatch Error</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The solution is to use your mail server's name as the hostname. In the code of your PHP mail form, you are using your domain as the mail <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">server name</a>. It may look something like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">$mail_host = "mail.example.com";
</pre>
</div>
<p>Instead of using your domain name in the mail server variable, use your actual mail server name.&nbsp;View the following article for instructions on how to locate your mail server name.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">How to find your mail servername</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Update your mail form code using an FTP client or SSH:</p>

</ul>
<p>In your mail form, change your hostname to the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">$mail_host = "<span class="code-highlight">imap.dreamhost.com</span>"; 
</pre>
</div>
<p>Changing the hostname fixes this error. Your mail hostname may differ from the one above. View the following article for further details on how to locate your specific mail servername.</p>
