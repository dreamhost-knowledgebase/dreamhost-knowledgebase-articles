<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Sendmail is a mail transfer agent (MTA) that is a well known project of the open source, free software, and Unix communities. It is distributed both as free software and proprietary software. It is used to route email over the Internet to a specific recipient, and can be done by running the sendmail command in a Shell environment. It can also be used within a programming script to send email.</p>
<p>This article covers a few simple examples of Sendmail.</p>

<h2><span id="Using_sendmail_from_the_command_line">Using sendmail from the command line</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following are two examples on how to send email from the command line using sendmail.</p>
<h3><span id="Simple_example">Simple example</span></h3>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> article for detailed instructions on how to log in to your web server via SSH. Once logged in, you can run the following command to send email:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">/usr/sbin/sendmail youremail@example.com</span>
<span class="code-highlight">Subject: Test Send Mail
Hello World</span>
control d (this key combination of control key and d will finish the email.)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The above example sends an email as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line indicates the email address sendmail will send the email TO.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Subject is 'Test Send Mail'.</li>
<li>The body of the message says 'Hello World'.</li>
<li>When the message is received, the FROM email address will appear as your user@server. For example, <span class="text-object">username@servername.dreamhost.com</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Adding_To_and_From_addresses">Adding To and From addresses</span></h3>
<p>This example is the same as the one above, but adds a specific To and From address:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">/usr/sbin/sendmail youremail@example.com</span>
<span class="code-highlight">To: differentemail@example.com
From: anyone@example.com
Subject: Test Send Mail
Hello World</span>
control d (this key combination will finish the email.)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The above example sends an email as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first line indicates the email address sendmail will send the email TO.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The email you enter into the To field does not receive an email. It only shows as the To address when the actual recipient receives the email. The recipient is still the first email you enter on the first line when running the command, and can also be the same if you wish.</li>
<li>The From address is what you entered: <span class="text-object">anyone@example.com</span>.</li>
<li>The Subject is what you entered: Test Send Mail.</li>
<li>The body of the message is what you entered: Hello World.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="Sendmail_in_a_cgi_script">Sendmail in a cgi script</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can also use sendmail in a script as well. This can be done in several languages. The following example shows a perl cgi script.</p>
<p>Create a file name <span class="text-object">perltest.pl</span> with the following code and make sure the permissions on the file are set to 755 or it will not run:</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Note how the To, From, and Subject fields do not end unless the line is ended with \n.</p>
</div>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
my($mailprog) = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';
my($from_address) ='<span class="code-highlight">AnyoneYouWant@example.com</span>';
my($to_address) ='<span class="code-highlight">email@example.com</span>';
       open (MAIL, "|$mailprog -t $to_address") || die "Can't open $mailprog!\n";
       print MAIL "To: $to_address\n";
       print MAIL "From: $from_address\n";
       print MAIL "<span class="code-highlight">Subject: Hello, self. Nice to email myself.</span>";
       print MAIL "<span class="code-highlight">This is still subject line.\n</span>";
       print MAIL "<span class="code-highlight">This is the body of my message.\n</span>";
       print MAIL "<span class="code-highlight">Pretty boring, yes?\n</span>";
       print MAIL "<span class="code-highlight">Goodbye.\n</span>";
       close (MAIL);
</pre>
</div>
<p>This example sends an email to <span class="text-object">email@example.com</span>.</p>
