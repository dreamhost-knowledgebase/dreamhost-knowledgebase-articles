<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When transmitting email, the content is sent through a specific port number. Mail submitted via SMTP traditionally defaults to port 25. For an overview of SMTP, view the following link:</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><a class="new" title="W:Anti-spam techniques (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques">TCP port 25 is frequently blocked</a> by <a class="new" title="W:Internet Service Provider (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">Internet Service Providers</a> (ISPs), as an anti-spam technique since it's used in MX spamming and abuse of open proxy/relay machines.</p>
<p>To send email on such ISPs, one must either:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the ISP's own SMTP server – This may require you to use the ISP's domain in your email address, rather than your own domain</li>
<li>connect to your SMTP server at DreamHost <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215612887#Outgoing_ports" target="_self">using port 465 or 587</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost blocks OUTGOING SMTP calls on shared servers. However, this is not a restriction on VPS/Dedicated servers. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a DreamHost customer sends email off of their web server via an SMTP script and they are attempting to connect to an external mail host (not a DreamHost mail server) then port 25 is blocked; but, they are able to connect from the web server via port 25 directly to any DreamHost mail server.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="The_solution">The solution</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The easiest solution is to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214918038-Email-client-configuration-overview">configure your email client</a> and set your outgoing port to 465 with SSL (recommended) or 587 with (STARTTLS).</p>
<p>Another option is to use your ISP’s SMTP server. If you are getting error messages when you try sending mail which state that <strong>smtp.example.com</strong> is not responding or not found, contact your ISP and find out if they're blocking port 25. If they are, you can probably send outgoing mail through their outgoing mail servers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, an ISP will not allow email to be sent through their SMTP server with a different domain. In other words, you may only be able to use their SMTP server if you have your reply address set to your ISP-based email address, not your custom domain name address that you have at DreamHost.</p>
