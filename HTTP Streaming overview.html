<p>All <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">hosting plans</a> at DreamHost support HTTP streaming media (also known as Progressive Download). You can use your DreamHost server to stream audio and video as long as they do not violate any Copyright laws.</p>
<p>If you have a music act or business, streaming media is a far more powerful tool than allowing MP3 downloads from your web sites. When you stream an audio or video file the user of that file is able to hear or see that file almost immediately because it plays as it downloads. When you download an MP3, you must wait until the entire file is loaded before you can use it.</p>
<h2><span id="Streaming_HTML5_audio">Streaming HTML5 audio</span></h2>
<p>You can easily stream audio with HTML5. Visit the following link for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class=" " href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp" rel="nofollow">HTML5 audio</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The audio file you wish to stream must be in a format that a browser is able to read. For music files, mp3 is the standard.</p>
<p>Here is a very simple example that creates an audio control box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the following code in the &lt;body&gt; of your HTML document</li>
<li>Make sure the .mp3 file is in the same directory as the file. Otherwise you must adjust the src= attribute</li>
</ul>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;audio controls&gt;
&lt;source src="Für_Elise.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>The <strong>&lt;audio&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;source&gt;</strong> tags also have several attributes you can adjust:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class=" " href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp" rel="nofollow">Audio tag attributes</a></li>
<li><a class=" " href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_source.asp" rel="nofollow">Source tag attributes</a></li>
</ul>
