<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A self-signed certificate is an SSL certificate that has not been validated by a Certificate Authority (CA). That's what meant in that it is 'self' signed.</p>
<p>The level of encryption can be the same as any other certificate, but because it's not validated by a CA, the browser will display a warning when visiting the site.&nbsp;For this reason, these types of certificates are only recommended for internal use on your website where no visitor would ever see or come into contact with.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="self_signed_warnings">Browser warnings for self-signed certificates</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Because a trusted authority did not sign it, browsers cannot trust it. It will still function normally, but visitors to your site will see a warning. Below are examples of what a visitor would see in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you want to attract visitors to your site, <strong>DO NOT</strong> use a self-signed certificate.</p>

<h2>Creating a self-signed certificate</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two options to create this type of certificate to use at DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create it via SSH command line</li>
<li>3rd party website</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a self-signed certificate via SSH</h3>
<p>You can run these commands on a Linux or Mac computer, however these instructions show how to log into your DreamHost web server to run the commands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your DreamHost web server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate into your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">user's home directory</a>:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cd ~</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Generate a new RSA private key by entering the following command.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">openssl genrsa -out Private.key 2048</span></pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>This creates a file named <span class="text-object">Private.key</span>.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Create the certificate using this new private key file.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">openssl req -new -x509 -key Private.key -out Certificate.crt -days 365</span>
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
Email Address []:</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>After running the command, you'll be asked for your site information to create a CSR. You can just press the <span class="code">Enter</span> key through these options without entering anything since your browser will throw a warning for the Self-Signed certificate by default.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Check to confirm both your private key and certificate have been created.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ls -1</span>
Certificate.crt
Private.key</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the private key and certificate have been created, you can install them in your panel using the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089668-Install-a-third-party-SSL-certificate">Install a third-party SSL certificate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Using SSH, you can open the files to view their contents by running cat:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cat Certificate.crt</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cat Private.key</span></pre>
</div>
<h3>Creating a self-signed cert with an online website</h3>
<p>There are several websites that allow you to create a self-signed certificate within it such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://getacert.com/index.html" target="_self">https://getacert.com/index.html</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS be default</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in <span class="text-object">https</span> before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (<span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>):</p>
