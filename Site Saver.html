<p>Site Saver is an automated Cloud backup tool you can add to your DreamHost account.</p>
<p>This is a paid service that backs up all sites on your account daily. Backups are kept for thirty days allowing you to retrieve any data within that time frame.</p>
<h2>Redundancy</h2>
<p>Backups are kept in three different Cloud data center locations. In case of an unrecoverable hardware error, your data is still safe at two other locations. This ensures everything you backup is safe and secure.</p>
<h2>Restore your site</h2>
<p>If necessary, you can restore your site from any backup within the last 30 days. You could also access specific files if you do not need the full backup.</p>
<h2>How to enable?</h2>
<p>You can enable this service in your panel on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.backups&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Cloud Services' &gt; 'Site Saver')</a> page. Click the '<strong>Enable Site Saver</strong>' button.</p>
<p>Once the service is enabled, the system will automatically backup your sites daily. You can then see the daily backups listed on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.backups&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Cloud Services' &gt; 'Site Saver')</a> page.</p>
