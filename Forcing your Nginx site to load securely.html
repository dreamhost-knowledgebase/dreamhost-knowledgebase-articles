<p>After you have&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">added an SSL certificate</a>&nbsp;to your domain,&nbsp;DreamHost automatically redirects the URL visitors use to view your site from HTTP to HTTPS. The 'S' ensures that your connection is encrypted. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https</strong>://example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>There's nothing on your end you must do in order to force your site to use the secure URL. However, in some special cases, it may be necessary for you to&nbsp;create your own custom configuration file to force the redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>Adding custom code is only necessary if your website requires specific code to force the redirect</strong>. If so, you will need to first disable the automatic redirect in your panel.</p>

</ul>
<p>Once disabled, you can then proceed with adding your custom redirect file.</p>

<p>To redirect a URL in a website running on an Nginx server, you must manually create a redirects.conf file. You will then add your redirect code to this file.&nbsp;View the following article for instructions on how to locate your Nginx configuration file location.</p>

<p>Once located, you can edit or create this file using an FTP client or SSH.</p>

<p>This redirect forces your site to load the HTTPS version of your site to ensure your visitor's connections are encrypted.&nbsp;Add the following code to your redirects.conf file.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">if ($server_port = 80) {
	rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://example.com/$1 permanent;
}
</pre>
