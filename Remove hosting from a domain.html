Choose one of the options below depending on which hosting plan you're using.</p>

<h2>Remove a domain's hosting if you have multiple domains hosted</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<p>You can do this by editing the domain and changing its hosting to any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-How-do-I-redirect-my-domain-">Redirect</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416417-Mirror-domain-overview">Mirror</a></li>
