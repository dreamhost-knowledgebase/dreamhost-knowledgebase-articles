<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you have two VPS machines, you can use the panel to migrate all data from one to the other. This assumes you've just added a brand new private server.</p>
</div>
<h2>Migrating</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPS</a> page.</li>
<li>To the right of the server you wish to delete, click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</li>
<li>You are presented with a page that offers you the option to migrate all data to a different server. In the screenshot above, everything is being migrated to a shared server.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Move everything on ps### to &lt;newserver&gt; and then destroy ps###!</strong>. This ensures your data is copied to the new server where you'll continue to host your site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your data will begin to migrate to the new private server. This could take some time depending on how much data there is to transfer. </p>
