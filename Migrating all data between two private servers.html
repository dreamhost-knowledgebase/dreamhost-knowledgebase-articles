<p>If you have two VPS machines, you can use the panel to migrate all data from one to the other. This assumes you've just added a brand new private server.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'VPS' &gt; 'Dashboard’</a>) page.<br/>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="04 Canceling Account VPS.fw.png" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/04_Canceling_Account_VPS.fw.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>To the right of the server you wish to delete, click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.

</dl>
</li>
<li>You are presented with a page that offers you the option to migrate all data to a different server. In the screenshot above, everything is being migrated to a Shared server.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Move everything on ps### to &lt;newserver&gt; and then destroy ps###!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your data will begin to migrate to the new private server. This could take some time depending on how much data there is to transfer. </p>
