<h2><span id="step1">Step 1&nbsp;— Initial setup</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The first step is to create a DreamHost account with a hosting plan. You will also need to own the domain registration (name of your domain).</p>
<h3>1: Choose a hosting plan and sign up for an account</h3>
<p>Before purchasing an account, you must first choose a hosting plan. The hosting plan contains multiple services but can be thought of as the server your website will be added to. Adding your site to the server is what allows it to appear on the Internet.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers several different hosting plan options depending on the needs of your website.&nbsp;The following article lists the different plan options available at DreamHost.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>In order to host a website online, you must choose one of the following hosting plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared Starter or Shared Unlimited hosting</li>
<li>VPS (private server)</li>
<li>Dedicated server</li>
<li>DreamPress (Managed WordPress hosting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided on the hosting plan, you may then proceed to purchase the plan and open a DreamHost account.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2: Purchase a domain registration</h3>
<p>A domain registration is the ownership of your domain name, such as <strong>example.com</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You cannot host (display) your domain online until you own the registration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>During the sign-up process, you can either purchase a new domain registration or transfer in an existing registration. You can also purchase a domain registration at a later time if you wish.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/224220668-How-to-purchase-a-domain-registration" target="_self">How to purchase a domain registration</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have already purchased the domain registration at a different company and don't want to transfer it to DreamHost, you could also just&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DreamHost-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">point the DNS to DreamHost</a>. This option allows you to keep the registration at a different company while hosting the domain online on DreamHost's servers.</p>
<h3>3: Add the domain to your hosting plan</h3>
<p>If you purchased a domain registration, the new domain should have also been added to the hosting plan so you can view it online. If not, you can always add hosting to the domain using the following article.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-" target="_self">How do I add a domain?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>At this point, you have created a DreamHost account you can log into at <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel.dreamhost.com</a>. Within this account, you have a domain registration that has been added to your hosting plan.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="step2">Step 2&nbsp;—&nbsp;Building your website</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Now that your site is hosted on your DreamHost server, you can begin to build it.</p>
<p>There are many different options available to build a website. Some options (such as a CMS) are easier and allow you to create a site without the need to code anything. Other options are&nbsp;more difficult but allow for greater customization over your site.</p>
<h3>Option 1&nbsp;&nbsp;— Using a CMS (Easiest option: No coding required)</h3>
<p>The easiest option to build a site is to use a CMS (Content Management System). This is pre-built software you install onto your site. This software creates a fully functioning website without any coding required. Once installed, you can log into the site and start customizing it the way you like.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You build and customize a site created using a CMS by logging into the backend of the website. This is where you will upload images, configure the appearance, and add text.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong></p>
<p>The most popular CMS option is WordPress. DreamHost offers this as both a One-Click Installation, or as a specialized upgraded hosting plan called DreamPress.</p>
<p><strong>One-Click WordPress install</strong></p>
<p>The One-Click Install immediately installs WordPress onto your site.</p>

</ul>
<p>An email is sent to you with instructions on how to complete the install. You can then log into the site at&nbsp;<strong>example.com/wp-login.php</strong> to begin adding your content.</p>
<p><strong>DreamPress</strong></p>
<p>DreamPress is a specific hosting plan DreamHost offers. It is a step up from hosting a WordPress site on a Shared or VPS hosting plan.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>When you purchase a DreamPress plan, WordPress is installed automatically for you. This DreamPress plan is specifically optimized for WordPress for simplicity and performance.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Option 2&nbsp; — Building a custom website (Difficult, but offers more customization)</h3>
<p>You could also manually build your website on your home computer and upload it to your DreamHost server. This would require you to at least have a basic level of website programming knowledge.&nbsp;Below are a few links to help you with building a website.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Upload your site to your server</strong></p>
<p>Once you've developed your site on your home computer, upload the content to your DreamHost server using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> client.</p>

<h2><span id="step3">Step 3 — Optimize your site</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After your website is set up on the server and displaying online, you should spend time optimizing it. Optimizing a site means making adjustments so it runs faster, appears correctly on different devices, and making design improvements for enhanced user experience.</p>

<h2><span id="step4">Step 4 — Attract visitors</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once your site is up and running, you need to publicize it to attract visitors. Allowing your site to be indexed by search engines will help display your site in search results.</p>
<h3>Submitting your site to search engines</h3>
<p>Visit the major search engines and submit your URL. Most of these sites allow you to create an account where you may submit your site to their database. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/basics/get-on-google" target="_self">Google — Get on Google</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bing.com/webmasters/about" target="_self">Bing — Webmaster Tools</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
<p>Making small adjustments to your site helps search engines to crawl and classify your content. This in turn helps push your site up in search results.</p>
