<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are several ways to redirect a URL. This is useful for those looking to redirect requests from their main domain to another directory under that domain. For example, such as directing requests for example.com to example.com/blog. This can be done using an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747748-How-can-I-redirect-and-rewrite-my-URLs-with-an-htaccess-file-">.htaccess file</a>. However, it's also possible to redirect using PHP.</p>
<p>This article gives you a quick example of how to create a redirect using PHP.</p>

<h2>Does redirecting work with https (SSL certificate)?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. Redirecting only works for 'http' URLs. If you enable an SSL certificate on 'example.com' and visit 'https://example.com', you will be redirected to the 'Site Not Found' page. This also applies to redirects <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-How-do-I-redirect-my-domain-">created in the DreamHost panel</a>.</p>

<li>Create a file named index.php. You can do this by using an FTP client such as Filezilla, or by using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. View the following articles for instructions on how to create it (depending on if you're using an FTP client or SSH):

<li>Make sure the file is in the domain's directory. This directory is the one specified when adding the domain to your panel. You can also confirm by navigating to <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> and clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of the domain.

<div class="alert-content">
<p>In the example above, the domain is websitehelp.support. Your domain shows instead when viewing your settings page.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>In this index.php file, add the following line of code:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;?php header("Location: http://www.example.com/blog"); ?&gt;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to change the sample URL to the URL you would like the site to forward.</p>
<p>You'll then have a simple and quick redirection that you can use to seamlessly redirect an HTTP request to any URL.</p>
