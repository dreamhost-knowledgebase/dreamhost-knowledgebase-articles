<h2>When do the changes to my plan take effect?</h2>

<p>If you are decreasing the amount of storage you need, the changes to your bill occur at the start of the next billing cycle.</p>
<p>If you are increasing from a less expensive plan to a more expensive one, the difference is charged immediately.</p>
