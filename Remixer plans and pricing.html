<h2>Is Remixer included in my DreamHost plan?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have already purchased a Shared hosting plan, Remixer '<strong>All Access</strong>' is included at no extra charge.</span></p>
<p>Remixer is not included in VPS, DreamPress, and Dedicated plans. To use Remixer <span style="font-weight: 400;">with your VPS or Dedicated</span> plan, you can purchase a Remixer Standard, Remixer All Access, or a Shared hosting plan. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Remixer does not work with DreamPress and is not included with standalone domain registrations.</span></p>
<h2>How to confirm which Remixer plan you've purchased</h2>
<p>You can view which Remixer plan you're on in your DreamHost panel. Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Manage Account</a> page. Here you'll see a Remixer line item. It either says 'Remixer Standard' or 'Remixer All Access'.</p>
