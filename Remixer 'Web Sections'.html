<h2>What is a Web Section?</h2>
<p>After you select a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005437667-Themes-in-Remixer">theme</a>, you are ready to edit it. Each theme is divided into sections called 'Web Sections'. Each 'Web Section' is an editable section of the page you can click to design the page. Furthermore, each 'Web Section' has a specific layout and design, so each 'Web Section' does something different for the page.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted an audio clip on your page, you would need to first add the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/227703127#audio">Audio 'Web Section'</a>. Once added, you can then edit the Audio 'Web Section' to upload your own audio.</p>
<p>After adding a 'Web Section', you can then customize any of the content you see within the section to fit your needs.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Each 'Web Section' is created within a single page. It's not possible to copy 'Web Sections' between different Remixer pages.</p>
<p>It's also not possible to edit or rearrange the structure of a 'Web Section'. You are able to edit only what you can click on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>How do I use them?</h2>
<p>When you choose a theme, several 'Web Sections' are already built into it. You can click to edit any 'Web Section' to design your content.</p>
<p>If you'd like additional content such as a video, you would need to first add the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/227703127#video">Video 'Web Section'</a>. Once the specific 'Web Section' is added, you are able to edit it as you like.</p>
