<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your contact information changes, you must update your information in your panel so that you do not miss any important account-related notices. The panel also shows who is designated as the owner of the account and who is authorized to contact DreamHost support for account specific issues.</p>
<p>The following describes how to open the Profile Information page, as well as make changes to important information related to how DreamHost contacts you.</p>
</div>
<h2>Opening the Profile Information page</h2>

<p>To open the Profile information page, navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.over&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home</a> page in your panel:</p>

<h2>How to change your Contact Information</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The 'Contact Information' box displays contact information (name/address/phone number) for the primary owner of the account. The primary owner is automatically contacted whenever reminder emails are sent as well as account-specific notification emails.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to change any of your contact information. Enter your password and then click <strong>Save Changes</strong> when finished.</p>
<h2>How to change your Email and Communication Preferences</h2>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You must enter a primary email address for your account thatâ€™s <em>not&nbsp;</em>hosted at DreamHost (i.e., hosted externally, such as Gmail, Yahoo, or another personal or work email hosting provider).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The 'Email and Communications Preferences' box displays your primary email address and an optional secondary address for your account.</p>
<p>DreamHost allows you store up to two email addresses, and you must designate one of them as your 'Primary Address'. The Primary Address is also the email address you must use whenever you contact DreamHost with any account-related requests.</p>
<p>The 'Secondary Address' can be used so that others can contact DreamHost on your behalf, or if you wish to designate someone else to receive payment reminders from DreamHost.</p>
<p>Use the following steps if you ever need to change the Primary Address for your DreamHost account.</p>
<h3><span id="secondary">Changing the Primary Address</span></h3>
<p>If you only have one address listed, and wish to add another address to set as the primary one, you'll need to add it first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the 'Add a Secondary Address' link.</li>
<li>Enter a secondary email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save Address</strong> when finished.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in the next section to change it to the primary address.</li>
</ol>
<p>The newly-added secondary address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Changing the Primary Address if you have two addresses listed</h3>
<p>If you have two addresses listed and wish to 'set as primary' the secondary address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Set as Primary</strong> button next to the secondary address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save All Changes</strong> when finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>The secondary address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Changing the Primary Address to a different address from the two that are listed</h3>
<p>Since DreamHost only allows you to store two email addresses in your profile, you must delete one before adding a new address in order to set it as the primary one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button next to the address that you wish to delete.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save All Changes</strong> to confirm.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in the <a class="reference internal" href="#secondary">previous section</a> to add a new secondary address.</li>
<li>After you add the new address, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Set as Primary</strong> button next to the new address you just added.</li>
</ol>
<p>The&nbsp;newly-added secondary address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Important notes to keep in mind when changing a Primary or Secondary Address</h3>
<p>Changing your primary email address will change the email address that is used to log in to the DreamHost panel. Before changing your primary email address, <em>make absolutely sure that the email address you enter is accurate</em> in order to prevent any panel login issues.</p>
<p>If you add a secondary email address, make sure you do <strong>not</strong> also add this email as a new user with Account Privileges. See the following article for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview">Account Privileges overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a secondary email address AND you create a new account-privileged user with this same address, the user will NOT be able to reset their panel password.</p>
<h2>Privacy Settings notice</h2>
<p>The following information about your privacy settings appears at the bottom of the Profile Information page:</p>
