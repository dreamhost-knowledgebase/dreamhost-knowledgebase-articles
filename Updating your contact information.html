<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your contact information changes, you must update your information in your panel so that you do not miss any important account-related notices. The panel also shows who is designated as the owner of the account and who is authorized to contact DreamHost support for account-specific issues.</p>
<p>The following describes where to find the <span class="panel-page">Profile Information</span> page, as well as how to make changes to your contact information so DreamHost can contact you.</p>

<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to change any of your contact information. Enter your password and then click <strong>Save Changes</strong> when finished.</p>
</div>
<h2>Email and Communication Preferences</h2>

<p>The <span class="text-object">Email and Communications Preferences</span> box displays your primary email address as well as additional addresses for your account.</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You must enter a primary email address for your account thatâ€™s <em>not&nbsp;</em>hosted at DreamHost (i.e., hosted externally, such as Gmail, Yahoo, or another personal or work email hosting provider).</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>How many email addresses can I save?</h3>
<p>DreamHost allows you to store up to two email addresses, but you <em>must</em> designate one of them as your <strong>Primary Address</strong>. The Primary Address is also the email address you must use whenever you contact DreamHost with any account-related requests.</p>
<h3>Why should I enter a secondary email address?</h3>
<p>An additional address can be used as a backup email address through which DreamHost can contact you. For example, if you're on vacation or otherwise unable to view or reply to emails sent to your primary address, DreamHost can then contact you at the secondary address.</p>
<p>You should <em>not</em> use a secondary email address to grant full access to your DreamHost account: If you wish to provide another person with access privileges to DreamHost on your behalf, you should instead use <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview" target="_self">Account Privileges</a> to grant access to your account.</p>
<h3>Does my secondary email address have the same privileges as my primary address?</h3>
<p>No. A secondary address has limited access to your DreamHost account and can only obtain basic information about DreamHost services, products, and general technical support issues. You also cannot contact DreamHost from your secondary address to request billing or detailed account information.</p>
<p><em>Only</em> the Primary Address can access sensitive account information, such as resetting a password, requesting account-specific information, or receiving DreamHost account service notices.</p>
<p>You can, however, log into the DreamHost panel with either email address (primary or secondary).</p>
</div>
<h2>How to change the primary email address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Use the following steps if you ever need to change the Primary Address for your DreamHost account.</p>
<h3><span id="secondary">Changing the Primary Address</span></h3>
<p>If you only have one address listed, and wish to add another address to set as the primary one, you'll need to add it first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="text-link">Add Another Address</span> link.</li>
<li>Enter an additional email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save Address</strong> when finished.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in the next section to change it to the primary address.</li>
</ol>
<p>The newly-added address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Changing the Primary Address if you have two addresses listed</h3>
<p>If you have two addresses listed and wish to 'Set as Primary' the additional address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Set as Primary</strong> button next to the additional address. If both addresses are hosted at DreamHost, then proceed to the next section to add new non-DreamHost hosted email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save All Changes</strong> when finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>The additional address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Changing the Primary Address to a different address from the two that are listed</h3>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Use these instructions if both listed email addresses are hosted at DreamHost. You must use a non-DreamHost hosted email as your primary address.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="text-link">Add Another Address</span> link.</li>
<li>Enter an additional email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save Address</strong> when finished.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in the <a class="reference internal" href="#secondary">previous section</a> to select the additional email as the primary address.</li>
</ol>
<p>The newly-added address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Important notes to keep in mind when changing a Primary or Secondary Address</h3>
<p>Changing your primary email address will change the email address that is used to log in to the DreamHost panel. Before changing your primary email address, <em>make absolutely sure that the email address you enter is accurate</em> in order to prevent any panel login issues.</p>
<p>If you add an additional email address, make sure you do <strong>not</strong> also add this email as a new user with Account Privileges. See the following article for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview" target="_self">Account Privileges overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you've stored an additional email address AND you create a new account-privileged user with this same address, the user will NOT be able to reset their panel password.</p>
</div>
<h2>Privacy Settings notice</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
