<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your contact information changes, you must update your information in your panel so that you do not miss any important account-related notices. The panel also shows who is designated as the owner of the account and who is authorized to contact DreamHost support for account specific issues.</p>
<p>The following describes how to open the <span class="panel-page">Profile Information</span> page, as well as make changes to important information related to how DreamHost contacts you.</p>
</div>
<h2>Opening the Profile Information page</h2>

<p>To open the Profile information page, navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.over&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home</a> page in your panel:</p>

<h2>How to change your Contact Information</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The <span class="panel-object">Contact Information</span> box displays contact information (name/address/phone number) for the primary owner of the account. The primary owner is automatically contacted whenever reminder emails are sent as well as account-specific notification emails.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to change any of your contact information. Enter your password and then click <strong>Save Changes</strong> when finished.</p>
<h2>How to change your Email and Communication Preferences</h2>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You must enter a primary email address for your account thatâ€™s <em>not&nbsp;</em>hosted at DreamHost (i.e., hosted externally, such as Gmail, Yahoo, or another personal or work email hosting provider).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <span class="panel-object">Email and Communications Preferences</span> box displays your primary email address as well as additional addresses for your account.</p>
<p>DreamHost allows you store up to two email addresses, and you must designate one of them as your 'Primary Address'. The Primary Address is also the email address you must use whenever you contact DreamHost with any account-related requests.</p>
<p>An additional address can be used as a backup email address through which DreamHost can contact you (if you wish to provide another person to access DreamHost on your behalf, DreamHost offers <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview" target="_self">Account Privileges</a> to provide them with their own access to your account).</p>
<p>Use the following steps if you ever need to change the Primary Address for your DreamHost account.</p>
<h3><span id="secondary">Changing the Primary Address</span></h3>
<p>If you only have one address listed, and wish to add another address to set as the primary one, you'll need to add it first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="panel-object">Add Another Address</span> link.</li>
<li>Enter an additional email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save Address</strong> when finished.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in the next section to change it to the primary address.</li>
</ol>
<p>The newly-added address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Changing the Primary Address if you have two addresses listed</h3>
<p>If you have two addresses listed and wish to 'Set as Primary' the additional address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Set as Primary</strong> button next to the additional address. If both addresses are hosted at DreamHost, then proceed to the next section to add new non-DreamHost hosted email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save All Changes</strong> when finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>The additional address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Changing the Primary Address to a different address from the two that are listed</h3>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Use these instructions if both listed email addresses are hosted at DreamHost. You must use a non-DreamHost hosted email as your primary address.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="panel-object">Add Another Address</span> link.</li>
<li>Enter an additional email address.</li>
<li>Enter the password for your account and click <strong>Save Address</strong> when finished.</li>
<li>Follow the steps in the <a class="reference internal" href="#secondary">previous section</a> to select the additional email as the primary address.</li>
</ol>
<p>The newly-added address is now set as the primary one.</p>
<h3>Important notes to keep in mind when changing a Primary or Secondary Address</h3>
<p>Changing your primary email address will change the email address that is used to log in to the DreamHost panel. Before changing your primary email address, <em>make absolutely sure that the email address you enter is accurate</em> in order to prevent any panel login issues.</p>
<p>If you add an additional email address, make sure you do <strong>not</strong> also add this email as a new user with Account Privileges. See the following article for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview" target="_self">Account Privileges overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you've stored an additional email address AND you create a new account-privileged user with this same address, the user will NOT be able to reset their panel password.</p>
<h2>Privacy Settings notice</h2>
<p>The following information about your privacy settings appears at the bottom of the Profile Information page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/sub-processors.png" alt="sub processors" /></dd>
