<p>Temporary SSL certificates are simply Self-Signed certificates. It is no longer possible to create these in the panel, however there are two instances when you will see them displayed in your panel.</p>
<h3>If you previously added a Self-Signed certificate in the panel</h3>
<p>If you had added a Self-Signed certificate to your domain in the past, it will continue to function. However the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Secure Hosting</a> page now displays it as a 'Temporary' certificate. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/temporary-ssl.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you'd like to change this to a Let's Encrypt or Comodo certificate, view the following article:</p>

</ul>
<h3>If you are in the process of adding a Comodo certificate</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to add a Comodo certificate.</p>

</ul>
<p>After its been purchased, the panel automatically installs it. During this process, a temporary certificate is set up.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_comodo_06.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>When the Comodo certificate is finally installed, it takes the place of this temporary certificate.</p>
