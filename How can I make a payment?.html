<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you have a balance due immediately, or are nearing account suspension, it is recommended that you use a credit card or PayPal for quicker service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Depending on your payment method, it may take various lengths of time to process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card payments post almost instantly.</li>
<li>If you are using PayPal to make a payment, it may take some time for PayPal to approve and post a payment to your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Electronic checks, mailed checks, or money order payments can take several weeks to process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a payment clears, it is applied to your account and DreamHost will send you a receipt for the payment to your account profile's email address. Bank statements show the charge as coming from ‘DreamHost - DH-FEE.com’.</p>
<h3><span id="not_due">What happens if I make a payment on an item that is not due yet?</span></h3>
<p>If you make a payment towards an item that has not renewed yet (such as a yearly hosting or a domain registration fee), that payment posts as a positive credit on the account until the specific item’s renewal date.</p>
<h3><span id="view_invoice">How do I view my invoice?</span></h3>
<p>See the following article for instructions on how to view an invoice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215202517-How-can-I-view-my-invoices-">View your invoices</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="cannot_access">I can't access my account—what should I do?</span></h3>
<p>If you cannot log into your panel, try resetting your password:</p>

<h3><span id="up_front">How do I handle "up-front" payments, such as domain registrations?</span></h3>
<p>If you are purchasing any items that require payment up front (such as a new domain registration or renewal), payment must be made via credit card only. This is because the payment is applied immediately and then the request is sent right away to the registry on your behalf. You can also make a pre-payment with PayPal by following the instructions at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249678#PayPal">How can I use PayPal to register or renew a domain name?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="exceptions">Are there any exceptions to these payment methods?</span></h3>
<p>Some international or prepaid credit cards, even if they have a Visa/MasterCard logo on them, may not be accepted due to limitations set by their own financial institutions.</p>
