<p>You must use a credit card to initially open a new account, which prevents fraudulent accounts from being opened. After the initial payment is received and the account is approved, you may make subsequent payments using any of the following accepted payment methods listed in this article.</p>

</div>
<h2>Using the DreamHost panel to make a payment</h2>
<p>Payments must be made through your DreamHost panel which offers a secure way to transmit payment data.</p>
<p>To make a payment, navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.payment&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Billing &amp; Account' &gt; 'Make Payment'</a>) page.</p>

</dl>
<p>You can select the following payment options, which are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit/Debit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and Diners Club)</li>
<li>Electronic Check / ACH</li>
<li>PayPal</li>

<li>Check or Money Order</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="credit_card">Using a credit or debit card to make a payment</span></h2>
<p>You can either set up Autopay or make a single payment using a credit or debit card. The advantage of setting up Autopay is that DreamHost will automatically charge your card whenever a payment is due, which saves you time and hassle in paying for recurring charges every month.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3><span id="how_long">How long does it take for my payment to process and post?</span></h3>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://kbimages.objects-us-east-1.dream.io/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you have a balance due immediately, or are nearing account suspension, it is recommended that you use a credit card or PayPal for quicker service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Depending on your payment method, it may take various lengths of time to process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card payments post almost instantly.</li>
<li>If you are using PayPal to make a payment, it may take some time for PayPal to approve and post a payment to your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Electronic checks, mailed checks, or money order payments can take several weeks to process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a payment clears, it is applied to your account and DreamHost will send you a receipt for the payment to your account profile's email address. Bank statements show the charge as coming from ‘DreamHost - DH-FEE.com’.</p>
<h3><span id="not_due">What happens if I make a payment on an item that is not due yet?</span></h3>
<p>If you make a payment towards an item that has not renewed yet (such as a yearly hosting or a domain registration fee), that payment posts as a positive credit on the account until the specific item’s renewal date.</p>
<h3><span id="view_invoice">How do I view my invoice?</span></h3>
<p>See the following article for instructions on how to view an invoice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215202517-How-can-I-view-my-invoices-">View your invoices</a></li>

<h3><span id="cannot_access">I can't access my account—what should I do?</span></h3>

<p>If this does not work, fill out the following form to contact support:</p>

</ul>
<h3><span id="up_front">How do I handle "up-front" payments, such as domain registrations?</span></h3>
<p>If you are purchasing any items that require payment up front (such as a new domain registration or renewal), payment must be made via credit card only. This is because the payment is applied immediately and then the request is sent right away to the registry on your behalf. You can also make a pre-payment with PayPal by following the instructions at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215249678#PayPal">How can I use PayPal to register or renew a domain name?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="exceptions">Are there any exceptions to these payment methods?</span></h3>
<p>Some international or prepaid credit cards, even if they have a Visa/MasterCard logo on them, may not be accepted due to limitations set by their own financial institutions.</p>
