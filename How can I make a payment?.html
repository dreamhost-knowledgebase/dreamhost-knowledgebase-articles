<p>You can make a payment at any time to your DreamHost account. If you make a payment towards an item that has not renewed yet (such as a yearly hosting or domain registration fee), that payment posts as a positive credit on the account until the specific item’s renewal date.</p>
<h2>Using the DreamHost panel to make a payment</h2>
<p>Payments must be made through your DreamHost panel which offers a secure way to transmit payment data.</p>

<h2>Important notes regarding your payment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Credit card payments post almost instantly.</li>
<li>If you are using PayPal to make a payment, it takes some time for PayPal to approve and post a payment to your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>Electronic checks, mailed checks, or money order payments can take several weeks to process.</li>
<li>If you have a balance due immediately, or are nearing account suspension, it is recommended that you use a credit card or PayPal for quicker service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a payment clears, it is applied to your account and DreamHost will send you a receipt for the payment to your account profile's email address. Bank statements show the charge as coming from ‘DreamHost - DH-FEE.com’.</p>
