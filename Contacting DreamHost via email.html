<p>The preferred method to contact support is through email correspondence through your <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">panel</a>. Support is able to answer most questions you may have and also provide you with links, examples, and so on that assist you in diagnosing an issue you're experiencing.</p>

<h2><span id="Attachments">Attachments</span></h2>
<p>If you would like to attach an image or file with your support request, you must submit your ticket in your DreamHost panel. The last page of the submission process allows you to add an attachment.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Attachments cannot be sent directly through email. The DreamHost system strips all attachments out if the ticket is not submitted through the panel.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you are already a customer you can upload the file via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> to your DreamHost server. When submitting your ticket, make sure to explain exactly where you uploaded the file.</p>
<p>If you are not yet a customer, or you are unable to use FTP to upload a file, there are many free web sites that allow you to upload the file to their servers. You can then link DreamHost support to that file. Below is a list of recommended sites you can use to link a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imgur.com">Imgur</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tinypic.com">TinyPic</a></li>
