<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The preferred method to contact support is through email correspondence through your <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">panel</a>. Support can answer most questions you may have and provide links, examples, and so on that assist you in diagnosing an issue you're experiencing.</p>
<p>When contacting support, DreamHost's goal is for you to have as close to 0 wait time as possible - within one to two hours via email. However, a technician may not be immediately available to respond – please be patient as DreamHost support works to address your issue.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HHYNCREXJADA6R4MCW7WZFB9"><span id="Attachments">Attaching files</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you want to attach an image or file with your support request, submit your ticket in your DreamHost panel. The last page of the submission process allows you to add an attachment.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can upload the file via FTP to your DreamHost server if you are already a customer. When submitting your ticket, explain exactly where you uploaded the file.</p>
<p>If you are not yet a customer or cannot use FTP to upload a file, many free websites allow you to upload it to their servers. You can then link DreamHost support to that file. Below is a list of recommended sites you can use to link a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_self">Your Google Drive account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com">Imgur</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tinypic.com">TinyPic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imageshack.com">ImageShack</a></li>
