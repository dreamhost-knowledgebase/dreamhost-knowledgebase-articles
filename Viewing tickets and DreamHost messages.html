<h3>Viewing open tickets</h3>
<p>If you have a ticket that support has not yet responded to, it will show at the top under 'Open Tickets'. You can click the 'Withdraw' link to the right if you wish to close it. Otherwise, support will respond back to you shortly.</p>
<h3>Viewing tickets you previously submitted</h3>
<p>If you have previously submitted a ticket, a <span class="text-object">silhouette</span> icon appears to the left. In this example, tickets titled 'phpMyAdmin Login' and 'Change nameservers?' were submitted. You can click these messages to view their contents.</p>
<h3>Viewing DreamHost's replies</h3>
<p>If DreamHost has already responded, you will see a <span class="text-object">moon</span> icon to the left of a ticket starting with 'Re:'. In this example, the DreamHost response is titled 'Re: Change nameservers'. You can click this message to view its contents.</p>
<h3>Viewing DreamHost's account messages</h3>
<p>DreamHost sends you account messages when an event directly related to your account occurs. These message also display a <span class="text-object">moon</span> icon to the left of the message.</p>
<p>In this example, DreamHost informed the user that 'Email Maintenance' was scheduled for their account.</p>
<h3>Viewing account actions</h3>
<p>Whenever you make a change to your account, the panel sends you a ticket confirming the action. In this example, WordPress was installed, so a message titled 'Success installing WordPress on your site!' appears.</p>
