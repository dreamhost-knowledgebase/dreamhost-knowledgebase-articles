<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When emails are sent, the email program or script can say the sender is "from" any address it wants. Email spoofing occurs when email is sent with a forged FROM address. For example, you can send emails from your website <strong>example.com</strong> that are "from" <span class="text-object">FakeFromAddress@example.com</span>. So, it’s always possible to change the FROM address when sending email.</p>
<p>This article details good and bad spoofing and explains DreamHost’s sender domain policy which protects legitimate email.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_useful_spoofing.3F">What is useful spoofing?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Without spoofing, any email sent from your website would be sent "from" youruser@yourserver.dreamhost.com. While that's accurate, it's not very nice to look at, and can be confusing to site users or customers who expect to see the email coming from the same domain name as your website. So in a sense, the email is spoofed to clearly show it’s originating from your website.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Spammers often use email spoofing to hide from where their spam emails are sent. They do this so they can send out hundreds of emails that appear to be originating from your website. If you receive "undeliverable" bounced emails that you never actually sent, a spammer could be spoofing your domain.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>DreamHost recommends that you do not <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215686487-Configure-Anti-Spam-settings" target="_self">whitelist your own email address or domain</a>, as it may allow spammers to spoof your address much more easily.</p>

<p>DKIM records can make spoofed emails more easily recognizable as suspicious, and hopefully discourage the spammers from spoofing your domain:</p>

<p>This basic code sends contact form emails using your email address as the sender. The $visitor_name, $visitor_email, and $message are set by the contact form:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">//set the recipient email address, where to send emails to
$to_email = <span class="code-highlight">incoming@example.com</span>;
<br />//set the sender email address
$your_email = <span class="code-highlight">administrator@example.com</span>;
<br />//use your email address as the sender
$header = "From: " . $your_email . "\r\n";
<br />//put the site visitor's address in the Reply-To header
$header .= "Reply-To: " . $visitor_email . "\r\n";
<br />//set the email Subject using the site visitor's name
$subject = "Contact Form Submission from " . $visitor_name;
<br />//set the email body with all the site visitor's information
$emailMessage = "Name: " . $visitor_name . "\r\n";
$emailMessage .= "Email: " . $visitor_email . "\r\n";
$emailMessage .= "Message: " $message . "\r\n";
<br />//send the email
mail($to_email, $subject, $emailMessage, $header);

<p>This code only spoofed the FROM header (the one seen in a mail client program). Any bounces or error messages from the mail server are sent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_address">envelope sender</a>, which was left unspoofed and will still be the default username@server.dreamhost.com address.</p>
</div>
<p>To spoof the envelope sender and have bounced emails go to that email address instead of the <span class="text-object">Maildir/new</span> directory on the webserver, use the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php">mail function's -f additional parameter</a> as in the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">mail($to_email, $subject, $emailMessage, $header, "<span class="code-highlight">-f$your_email"</span>);</pre>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your domain does not use regular DreamHost-hosted mail service, then your domain may have mail service from another provider like Google Suite. For these domains, your website must use SMTP to connect directly to your domain's mail server. In this way, your website logs in to your mail account at that host and sends email through their server instead of through DreamHost's mail servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress has SMTP support via a plugin. There are many SMTP plugins to choose from, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215526937-Configuring-the-WP-Mail-SMTP-plugin" target="_self" rel="undefined">WP Mail SMTP</a> is one</li>
<li>Joomla has built-in <a href="https://docs.joomla.org/J3.1:Global_configuration#.E2.80.9CMail_Settings.E2.80.9D_Group" rel="nofollow">SMTP support (version 3.1)</a></li>
<li>phpBB has built-in <a href="https://www.phpbb.com/support/docs/en/3.0/ug/adminguide/general_client/">SMTP support</a></li>
<li>ZenCart has built-in <a href="https://docs.zen-cart.com/user/email/">SMTP support</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your website was built by you or someone else by hand and is written in PHP, you can add SMTP support using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215842658-PHPmailer-overview">PHPMailer</a>. Just use the SMTP host/server your email provider gives you, and your username and password in their system. Another option is to use the PEAR Mail package to send via SMTP.
