<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A mirror allows you to upload your content to your DreamHost server for one site (site A), but use another site’s URL (site B) on the same account to view the original site (site A).</p>
<p>More technically, a mirror domain is a server alias on the DreamHost server that allows you to access the same DreamHost site content under more than one address. For example, you can have a .com and a .net site that share the same content or access your site live before your domain is set up. View the following article for further information:</p>

</ul>
<p>A mirror domain can only "mirror" an existing domain at DreamHost, as it is merely a server alias. A mirror domain is a "mirror" only in terms of address aliasing; it is not a physical mirror, and there is no content duplication involved, nor is it a "cloaking" or "domain gripping" facility.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Mirrored domains do not work well or at all with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Some CMS applications (WordPress for example)</strong> — This is because some CMS applications hard-code the URL for the site and actively rewrite the URL in the browser address bar. This causes the URL for the site to change, effectively ruining the mirrored settings. If this is the case, you may need to make further adjustments within the CMS.</li>
<li><strong>DreamPress</strong> — A mirror of a DreamPress site will not work in most cases due to DreamPress caching.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your domain's DNS records are not pointed to DreamHost, and you wish to set up the domain before changing the DNS to minimize downtime, you can use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284771-Using-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain">dreamhosters.com subdomain</a>. You can read about how to set that up in the following article:</p>

</ul>
<p>Setting up a subdomain can take several hours, so a faster alternative for the technically inclined is to modify your host file to point to your DreamHost DNS records. The following article explains how to do this:</p>

<h2><span id="Internal_linking">Internal linking</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To have links on a site stay within the original URL address, they must not contain the domain name. This is called using a relative link or path. For example, if <strong>mirror.example.com</strong> is the mirror for the actual site named <strong>example.com</strong>, any links on the <strong>example.com</strong> site that contain <strong>example.com</strong> will take visitors to <strong>example.com</strong>. This defeats the purpose of a mirror.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><span class="text-object">Good (Relative):</span> /about-us.html
<dl>
<dd><em>This works and keeps the user at the current URL.</em></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><span class="text-object">Bad (Absolute):</span> <strong>https://www.example.com/about-us.html</strong>
<dl>
<dd><em>This takes the user away from <strong>mirror.example.com</strong>. With this type of linking, it makes more sense to redirect rather than mirror.</em></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd></dd>
<dd></dd>
</dl>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Using relative paths is also essential if you implement secure hosting on your site since you won’t have to change any absolute links/paths from <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>.</p>

<h2><span id="A_reason_to_use_a_redirect_domain_instead">A reason to use a redirect domain instead</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In many situations, it is better to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-Redirect-a-domain">redirect a domain</a> if you want the same content accessible from different domains. This is where visitors to any alternative domains are automatically redirected to your primary domain instead of seeing identical content at the alternative URL.</p>
<p>The main difference is the URL you see: if you create a mirror at <strong>siteB.example.com</strong> that mirrors the actual website named <strong>siteA.example.com</strong>, when you visit <strong>siteB.example.com</strong> the address bar does not change. But you still see the content of <strong>siteA.com</strong>.</p>
<p>If you create a redirect when you visit <strong>siteB.example.com</strong>, the address bar changes to <strong>siteA.example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>Almost all search engines blacklist your domain if they find the same content as another domain, which drops your site very far down in their search results. If you want the same content accessible from different URLs, it is best to use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-Redirect-a-domain">redirect</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing an existing domain or subdomain to a Mirror</h2>

<h2>Turning off a Mirror</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To turn off a Mirror, you must change the hosting configuration to any other option, such as '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting" target="_self">Fully Hosted</a>' or '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056398191-Setting-your-domain-to-DNS-Only-" target="_self">DNS Only</a>'.</p>
</div>
<h2>Will the mirror domain work with https?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. If the site is mirroring a domain with <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">https enabled</a>, the mirror site will throw an error when visited. For example:</p>
<p>Let's say you set up the site <strong>example.com</strong> to mirror <strong>https://dreamhostexample.com</strong>. When you visit <strong>example.com</strong>, the URL will change to <strong>https://example.com</strong> and attempt to mirror the content of <strong>https://dreamhostexample.com</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the SSL certificate is not installed on <strong>example.com</strong>, the browser throws an error letting the visitor know that the site is not secure.</p>
<p>For this reason, you should not mirror a site using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">SSL certificate</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>How long until the mirror is working?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Mirroring your site is the same as any other DNS change. This means the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> first before you can see the changes online. In general, this shouldn't take any longer than 6 hours. You can keep track of when the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">new DNS records</a> update in different locations using either of the following links:</p>
