<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Most often, an SSL certificate is added to a domain you are already hosting in your account. This means that when it's purchased, it's assigned to a specific domain name.</p>
<p>You also have the option of adding a Stand-alone SSL certificate. This allows you to purchase the SSL certificate at DreamHost, but use at a different company. This article walks you through the process of purchasing this type of certificate.</p>
