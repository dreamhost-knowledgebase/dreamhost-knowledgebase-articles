<p>The following is an overview of how auto-renew domains are charged and renewed at DreamHost.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between the expiration and renewal date?</h2>
<p>First, it's important to understand the difference between the expiration date and renewal date of a domain:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/expiration_and_renewal_date.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3>Expiration date</h3>
<p>This is the date the domain name officially expires. For all domains, it is one day before a full calendar year from when you originally purchased the domain.</p>
<p>You can view this date by visiting the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page, or running a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215842648-How-to-run-a-WHOIS-query">WHOIS query</a> and looking for the 'Expiration date' line item. </p>
<h3>Renewal date</h3>
<p>This date is different depending on if your domain is a general domain (such as .com) or a specific 'Auto-Renew Only' domain (<a class="reference internal" href="#auto_only_tlds">see below</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General domains</strong> — The domain is charged and renewed 31 days prior to the expiration date.</li>
<li><strong>'Auto-Renew Only' domains </strong>—  The domain is still charged 31 days prior to the expiration date, however the renewal date is different: the renewal date is the same as the expiration date.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to check if a domain is set to auto-renew</h2>
<h3>Regular domains</h3>
<p>You can set a regular domain to auto-renew on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page. When you set it to auto-renew, the option is set to '<strong>YES</strong>'.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Renew_Date.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3>'Auto-Renew Only' domains</h3>
<p>The auto-renew setting is found on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page.</p>
<p>The "Auto-renew by" or "Delete by" deadline is listed on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page, directly beside the expiration date.</p>
<p>To renew an 'Auto-Renew Only' domain correctly, the domain's auto-renew setting must be enabled <strong>prior</strong> to the “Auto-renew by” or "Delete by" date found in the panel.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Auto-Renew_Only.png" /></dd>

</dl>
<p>If the domain is not auto-renewed on the expiration date as described below, it goes into a redemption period during which it can usually be recovered for an additional fee.</p>
<h2>How regular domains are billed if they are set to auto-renew</h2>
<p><strong>31 days prior to expiration date:</strong></p>

<p>A renewal receipt is emailed to the account owner that shows the date of charge and the date of renewal.</p>
<h2>How 'Auto-Renew Only' domains are billed</h2>
<h3>What are 'Auto-Renew Only' domains?</h3>
<p>Certain country-code and specialty top-level domains (TLDs) do not renew the same way as a .COM or other generic TLDs. These are referred to as 'Auto-Renew Only' domains.</p>
<p>These domains are <a href="#auto_only_tlds">specific domains determined by the registry</a>. They do not have an "Add Years" button on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page, and cannot be renewed by manually placing a renewal order.</p>
<h3><span id="auto_only_tlds">List of 'Auto-Renew Only' domains (TLDs) at DreamHost</span></h3>
<p>The following domains (TLDs) are 'Auto-Renew Only'. DreamHost strongly recommends that the auto-renew setting remain enabled on these domain names, unless the registrant chooses to discontinue renewing them:</p>
<ul>
<li>.AT</li>
<li>.DE</li>
<li>.IO</li>
<li>.JP</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does DreamHost charge my 'Auto-Renew Only' domain?</h3>
<p><strong>31 days prior to expiration date:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'Auto-Renew Only' domain is charged for the renewal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On the expiration date:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>'Auto-Renew Only' domain renews:</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the 31-day period between when it is charged and expires, you are not able to change the status of 'auto-renew' in the panel. This is a safeguard that ensures the domain does indeed renew, since you’ve already paid for the renewal. All of these details are reflected in the receipt that is emailed to you when the charge occurs.</p>
