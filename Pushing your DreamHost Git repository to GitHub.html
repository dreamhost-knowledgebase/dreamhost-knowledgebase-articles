<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's always a good idea to keep a copy of your repository on an external server in case your local copy is deleted. There are two general ways you can go about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create your application and Git repository on your DreamHost server. Then, you can push to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Create your application and Git repository on your home computer. Once it's ready, push the repo to your DreamHost server.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article explains how to push your repository on your DreamHost server to GitHub.</p>
<p>If you do not want to use GitHub, you can still create your site on your home computer, then push it to a repository on your DreamHost web server. View the following articles for instructions on how to do this:</p>

<p><strong>Create a github.com token</strong></p>
<p>Before proceeding, make sure you first create a new token in github.&nbsp;It's no longer possible to use a password when pushing a repository to github.com, so you must create an access token to continue.</p>
<p>This token will act as a password when committing your repository. View the following article for more information:</p>

<h2>Configure your DreamHost repository to use 'main' as the primary branch</h2>
<h3>If you have not created a local repository for your DreamHost files yet</h3>
<p>View the following article to configure your DreamHost repository:</p>

<h3>If you have already created a local repository for your DreamHost files</h3>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>This step is not required but will help to ensure future compatibility with third-party git software programs like github.com.</p>
</div>
<p>If you've already created a local repository on your DreamHost server, the primary branch name is <span class="text-object">master</span>. You may want to update this to <span class="text-object">main</span> to avoid future compatibility issues. View the following article for further information and instructions on how to change the branch name.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you've developed your site on your DreamHost server, it's recommended to put a copy on GitHub for two main purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This creates an external backup of your code, and</li>
<li>It makes future collaboration with other developers much easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow these steps to push your repository to GitHub</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>Create a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">public or private repository</a> in your GitHub account.
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Since you're pushing your repository to GitHub, do not initialize the new repository with a <span class="text-object">README</span>, license, or <span class="text-object">gitignore</span> files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub if needed.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Once created, <strong>github.com</strong> shows you several commands to run to push your git repository to their servers.</li>
<li>Log into your DreamHost server via&nbsp;<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>&nbsp;and navigate to your application folder where you set up your git repository.</li>
<li>Run the following command to push your app to GitHub:
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The word <span class="code">origin</span> is just an alias. It can be named anything you want. But this alias name will be used when you push your content to <strong>github.com</strong> as shown in the next step.</p>
<p><span class="code">repo_name</span> is the name of the repository you created at <strong>github.com</strong>. Make sure <span class="code">.git</span> is at the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">git remote add <span class="code-highlight">origin</span> https://github.com/<span class="code-highlight">github_username</span>/<span class="code-highlight">repo_name</span>.git</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">git push -u origin main</span></pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>When you run the <span class="code">push</span> command, you are prompted for your github username and password. Enter the token you created above in the password field.</p>
