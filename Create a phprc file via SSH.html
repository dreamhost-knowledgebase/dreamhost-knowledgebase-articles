<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every installation of PHP comes with default settings which are usually fine for most websites. Occasionally, the needs of a website makes it necessary to adjust these PHP settings. Creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini (phprc)</a> file is the solution to adjust the PHP settings for your website.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The standard term for a PHP configuration file is php.ini. However, DreamHost uses the term <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file instead. This acts the same way – only the name is different. In this article, only the term <span class="text-object">phprc</span> is used.</p>
</div>
<p>You can create a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214894037-Create-a-phprc-file-via-FTP">using an FTP client</a>, or by logging into the server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>, however creating a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file is easier using an FTP client. This article is for more advanced users and explains how to create this <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file via SSH.</p>

<p>Remember to first <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214898997-What-version-of-PHP-is-my-site-using-">check which version of PHP your site is using</a>. In the following example, the site is using PHP 8.3.

<li>Run the following command to change into the <span class="text-object">.phprc</span> directory:

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've saved your changes, you should kill off all running PHP processes. This ensures your new settings are updated. View the following article for instructions on how to kill off all running PHP processes:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HH4THAB4JD814Z0DKEXXTAMR">Confirming your changes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, you should check to confirm the values have updated. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-Viewing-your-site-s-PHP-version-and-settings">phpinfo.php file</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file you just created is used for any domains under this specific username that are also running the specific version of PHP you chose in step#3 when creating the directory.</p>
<p>For example, if the user has three domains where two are running PHP 8.3 and the third is running PHP 8.2, only the first two domains running 8.3 would be affected by the <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file. You would need to create a separate <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file for the PHP 8.2 site.</p>
