<h2 id="h_01HBGWM6JD9QKVYBS4PS53CBKE">Proving non-profit status</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Whether you are a new or current customer, to prove your non-profit status, DreamHost must receive one crucial piece of documentation: an official United States IRS letter indicating tax-exempt non-profit status under the appropriate sections of the tax code. These are often called <strong>501(c)(3) or 501(c)(19) determination letters</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>501(c)(3) or 501(c)(19) determination letters are the only documentation that DreamHost accepts.</strong> Regardless of the reason, you will be denied free hosting if you are a non-profit organization and do not have a determination letter.</p>
