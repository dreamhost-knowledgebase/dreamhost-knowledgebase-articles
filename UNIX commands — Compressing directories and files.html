<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Websites will often allow you to download a single compressed file that contains many other files. This makes it easier and faster to download through your browser since the file is smaller than the folder containing all the files.&nbsp;These compressed files usually end with these extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>.zip</li>
<li>.gz</li>
<li>.tar.gz</li>
<li>.tar.bz2</li>
</ul>
<p>You can decompress these on your computer using your computer's software. Otherwise, you could upload the compressed file to your web server and decompress it there using the commands found in the following article.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>But what if you need to do the opposite? What if you need to compress folders on your web server so you can download them to your local computer. All you need to do is log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> and run the commands shown below.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compressing a directory</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Compressing to a .zip file</h3>
<p>You can use the 'zip' command to compress a folder full of files. For example, if you have a WordPress site named <strong>example.com</strong>, you may want to compress all files and folders within it before downloading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following command compresses the directory named <span class="text-object">example.com</span> and creates a new zip file named <span class="text-object">example.com.zip</span>. The original directory remains untouched.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">zip -r example.com.zip example.com</span></pre>
</div>
<p>You can use the maximum compression setting (-9) which will attempt to compress all files. However, this may be slower:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">zip -9 -r example.com.zip example.com<br /></span></pre>
</div>
<h3>Compressing to a .tar.gz file</h3>
<p>The following command uses 'tar' to compress an <span class="text-object">images</span> directory into a file named <span class="text-object">image_backup.tar.gz</span>.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ <span class="command">tar zcvf image_backup.tar.gz images</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>The original folder will continue to exist.</p>
<h3>Compressing to a .tar.bz2 file</h3>
<p>The following command uses 'tar' to compress an <span class="text-object">images</span> directory into a file named <span class="text-object">image_backup.tar.bz2</span>.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ <span class="command">tar cjvf image_backup.tar.bz2 images</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>The original folder will continue to exist.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compressing files</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Compressing a file using GZIP</h3>
<p>The commands above show how to compress an entire directory. However sometimes you'll only need to compress a single file. To accomplish this you can use gzip. The following command compresses a file named <span class="text-object">test.log</span> and renames it test.log.gz. Please note that the 'test.log' file will no longer exist since it's been compressed.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ <span class="command">gzip test.log</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>If you still need the 'test.log' file to exist, run the following instead. This creates a gzipped copy of the file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ <span class="command">gzip -c test.log &gt; test.log.gz</span></span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Confirming your folder has been compressed</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once you run the commands above, check to confirm the directory has been compressed. You can do this using <span class="code">du -sh</span> for both the old and new directories.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">du -sh example.com.zip</span>
30M example.com_backup
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">du -sh example.com</span>
82M example.com</pre>
</div>
<p>You can see above that the compressed backup is smaller in size than the original folder.</p>
</div>
<h2>What command compresses a directory the most?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following shows how much a WordPress site is compressed using the different compression options.</p>
<p>First, check the size of the WordPress directory. This shows it's 82M.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">du -sh example.com</span>
82M example.com</pre>
</div>
<p>The following are the results of the different compression methods.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">du -sh example.com.zip</span>
30M example.com.zip
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">du -sh example.com.tar.gz</span>
27M example.com.tar.gz
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">du -sh example.com.tar.bz2</span>
24M example.com.tar.bz2
</pre>
</div>
<p>Overall, tar.bz2 compresses the most.</p>
