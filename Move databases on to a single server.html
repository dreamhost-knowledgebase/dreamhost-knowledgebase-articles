<p>Most often, your database services are always on a single database server. However, it’s possible that you may have databases split across two different database servers. It’s highly recommended to only use a single database server, as this makes troubleshooting any database-related issue much easier and makes it simpler to access all of your databases from a single set of users and hostnames.</p>

<p>Be aware that the migration does not begin immediately. Generally, these merges are performed in the middle of the night (PDT/PST) You are also given an opportunity to cancel the process if you choose not to proceed with the migration.</p>
<p>After clicking the button, a message informs you that this migration will take several hours to complete and that your site may not work properly during this process.</p>
<p>When the migration is finished, you will be emailed a confirmation.</p>

<p>At or after midnight, an automated script runs and consolidates your databases onto one server. Once the move is successful, a notification is sent to your email address.</p>
<p>If it takes more than a few hours, the script may have had some kind of problem, and you should contact support for further assistance:</p>
