<h2>Keeping your account secure</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost Security team has several simple suggestions for keeping your account secure and safe. The following are some best practices:</p>
<h3>Donâ€™t share credentials</h3>
<p>Do not share your passwords with anyone. If someone requires access to your account, try alternate options such as creating a new user for them or giving them panel access through <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview" target="_self">Account Privileges</a>. Refer to the guide linked below to learn how to set up Account Privileges:</p>

<h3>Enable Multifactor Authentication</h3>
<p>Multifactor Authentication adds a requirement for a one-time passcode that you enter before you can gain access to your DreamHost account. DreamHost recommends enabling it to give you account an extra layer of security, should the password be compromised. Follow the steps in the link below to enable it:</p>
