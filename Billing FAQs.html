<h2>Are there any special details to consider when making a payment by mail?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind if you are submitting a payment via mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are mailing in a check payment, please make sure that you write your account number on the check. This ensures that the payment is processed to the correct account. Checks missing the account number will be returned to you undeposited.</li>
<li>It can take 3 weeks for a check payment (or money order) to clear and be applied to your account. Please mail in your check payment early to ensure that your account is not suspended while DreamHost waits for your financial institution to approve the funds. If you need a payment extension or mailed the check late, please contact the DreamHost support team on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Support</a> page to request an extension.</li>
