<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Suhosin (pronounced 'su-ho-shin') is an advanced protection system for PHP installations. It was designed to protect servers and users from known and unknown flaws in PHP applications and the PHP core.</p>
<p>Suhosin comes in two independent parts, that can be used separately or in combination. The first part is a small patch against the PHP core, that implements a few low-level protections against buffer overflows or format string vulnerabilities. The second part is a powerful PHP extension that implements numerous other protections.</p>
