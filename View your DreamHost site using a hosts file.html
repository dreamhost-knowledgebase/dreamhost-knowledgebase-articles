<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMG0E96ZH8BKQQ7824Q">Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file is a text file on your home computer. It is used to map a domain name to a specific server. If you edit it, you can change where your computer searches for a website.</p>
<p>For example, when you look up a URL in your browser, your computer sends out a query into the Internet to find where your site is located. Your site is located where your DNS is pointed to. If you edit the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file, you can change where your computer searches for a website.</p>
<p>In this way you can view a site on your DreamHost server when the DNS is pointed to another company.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>This article explains how to view your site before pointing your DNS to DreamHost by editing the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file on your <strong>desktop or laptop</strong>&nbsp;computer (not a mobile device).</p>
<p>To test on a mobile device, or for another option on how to view your site at DreamHost before pointing DNS, view the following article:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHHCG05AFBTYB6XRSV">Locate your A records</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each site at DreamHost has two A records for the URL. One for your domain with and without www. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>208.113.137.245 example.com</li>
<li>208.113.137.245 www.example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> article for details on how to view these records. Make a note of these as you'll need to add the IP to your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file in the next step.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHH95X6R2HNQ0A2HNC">Using Windows 10</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On most Windows systems, you can find the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file in the following directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc
</pre>
</div>

</div>
</li>
<li>On the top left of this blank file, click the <span class="text-section">File &gt; Open...</span> menu option.</li>

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHCMSEGDXF725Q5JH1">Using Linux</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On most Linux-based systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file can be located in the <span class="text-object">/etc/</span> directory.</li>
<li>The <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file is usually called <span class="text-object">hosts</span>.</li>

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMH7CTWVA0P70ZVV8Q4">Move WordPress instructions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This section explains how to view your WordPress site (at DreamHost) if it was moved by the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004182807">Professional Services Team</a>. This section only applies to NON-DreamPress migrations.</p>
<p>First, read through the sections&nbsp;above to locate and edit your computer's <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file.</p>
<p>Normally, updating a <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file only requires you to add two lines (as mentioned above). With this migration process, you also need to add a third line of text for the MySQL server. For example, if your site was <strong>example.com</strong>, you would add these lines to the bottom of your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">111.111.111.111 example.com
111.111.111.111 www.example.com
222.222.222.222 mysql.example.com</pre>
</div>
<p>Replace the example IP addresses above with your site's actual IP addresses.</p>
<p>You can use the following instructions to find your IP addresses on the DNS records Page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!/grid-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a>&nbsp;page.</li>
<li>Open the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span> page:

<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-manage-websites-dns-settings.png" alt="DNS Settings" width="222" height="205" /></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043889332#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">Grid view</a>, click the 'vertical 3 dots' button for your domain. From the popout menu, click the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span>&nbsp;link.</li>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043889332#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">List view</a>, either click the <span class="text-link">DNS</span> link or click the 'vertical 3 dots' button to the right of your domain.&nbsp;From the popout menu, click the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span>&nbsp;link.
<dl>
<dd><em>The domain's DNS records display.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need further assistance locating your site's IP addresses, view the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> article for more detailed instructions.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMH5F69C3AT5SP08K91">Confirming the 'hosts' file is working</h3>
<p>You can confirm you are loading the migrated site from DreamHost's servers if you are able to load the following page (replacing <strong>example.com</strong> with your domain):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/quickstart.html</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMHWJ8000C0SHZE5NRN">View your public site through a proxy</h3>
<p>Once your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file is working, your computer will show you how your site looks at DreamHost. If you want to also view your current (public) site, you must use a proxy website.</p>
<p>An example of a proxy site is <a href="https://kproxy.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">kproxy.com</a>. Visit that link in your browser, enter your domain name in the box, then press <span class="code">Enter</span>. It uses your site's public DNS (not your local <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file) to view the site at your current hosting company.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMJS7YVH6PB5GNREAT5">Comparing the sites</h3>
<p>Viewing your site using a <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file and a proxy site allows you to view both versions of your site for a side by side comparison. You can have one browser tab open on the migrated site (viewed using your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file) and another browser tab open on the proxy site (viewed using DNS) to see your current public site.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMJYP2PZS08DT7BPMYV">Making further changes to your site</h3>
<p>During your inspection of the site, you may feel the need to change the setting of something that was out of scope of the migration service. Please refrain from changing anything that may alter the look or behavior of the site since the Professional Services Team must be able to compare the migrated site (at DreamHost) to the live site (at your current host).</p>
<p>If you must update something, make sure to document any change so the Professional Services Team can separate what may have been affected by the migration from subsequent alterations on your end.</p>
