<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHHCG05AFBTYB6XRSV">What is a hosts file?</h2>
<p>A <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file is a text file used by your computer to map a domain name to a specific server. If you edit it, you can change where your computer searches for a website.</p>
<p>For example, when you look up a URL in your browser, your computer sends out a query into the Internet to find where your site is located. Your site is located where your DNS is pointed to. If you edit the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file, you can change where your computer searches for a website. This allows you to&nbsp;view a site on your DreamHost server when the DNS is pointed to another company.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMHHCG05AFBTYB6XRSV">Locate your A records</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each site at DreamHost has two A records for the URL: one for your domain with and without www. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>208.113.137.245 example.com</li>
<li>208.113.137.245 www.example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Note these, as you'll need to add the IPs of each to your host file in the next step. The <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> article provides details on how to view these records.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHH95X6R2HNQ0A2HNC">Using Windows 10</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On most Windows systems, you can find the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file in the following directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc
</pre>
</div>
<p>Notepad is a basic text editing program that is already installed on Windows. To open the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file with Notepad, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <span class="text-section">Start</span> menu.</li>
<li>Start typing the word 'notepad', and it will display the icon.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <span class="text-object">Notepad</span> option and choose <span class="text-object">Run as administrator</span>.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You may receive a pop-up message titled <span class="text-object">User Access Control</span> asking, <span class="text-object">Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC?</span> Click <strong>Yes</strong>. This opens a blank Notepad file.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Click the <span class="text-section">File &gt; Open...</span> menu option in the top left of this blank file.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="text-object">This PC</span> in the Explorer window and then to the <span class="text-object">C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc</span> directory.

<li>Choose the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file and click <strong>Open</strong>. You may need to change the <span class="text-object">Text Documents (*.txt)</span> in the lower right to <span class="text-object">All Files</span> in the dropdown list.</li>
<li>Add your DreamHost site IP followed by the domain at the bottom of the file.

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHCMSEGDXF725Q5JH1">Using Linux</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On most Linux-based systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file can be located in the <span class="text-object">/etc/</span> directory.</li>
<li>The <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file is usually called <span class="text-object">hosts</span>.</li>
<li>The full path is <span class="text-object">/etc/hosts</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The steps to edit and save the file are the same as the 'Mac OS' instructions above.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMH7CTWVA0P70ZVV8Q4">Move WordPress instructions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This section explains how to view your WordPress site (at DreamHost) if it was moved by the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004182807">Professional Services Team</a>. This section only applies to NON-DreamPress migrations.</p>
<p>First, read the sections above to locate and edit your computer's <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file.</p>
<p>Normally, updating a <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file only requires adding two lines (as mentioned above). With this migration process, you must add a third line of text for the MySQL server. For example, if your site were <strong>example.com</strong>, you would add these lines to the bottom of your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">111.111.111.111 example.com
111.111.111.111 www.example.com
222.222.222.222 mysql.example.com</pre>
</div>
<p>Replace the example IP addresses above with your site's actual IP addresses.</p>
<p>You can use the following instructions to find your IP addresses on the DNS records Page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!/grid-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a>&nbsp;page.</li>
<li>Open the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span> page:
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-manage-websites-dns-settings.png" alt="DNS Settings" width="222" height="205" /></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043889332#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">Grid view</a>, click the 'vertical 3 dots' button for your domain. From the popout menu, click the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span>&nbsp;link.</li>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043889332#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">List view</a>, click the DNS link or the 'vertical 3 dots' button to the right of your domain.&nbsp;From the popout menu, click the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span>&nbsp;link.
<dl>
<dd><em>The domain's DNS records display.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you need further assistance locating your site's IP addresses, view the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> article for more detailed instructions.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMH5F69C3AT5SP08K91">Confirming the 'hosts' file is working</h3>
<p>You can confirm you are loading the migrated site from DreamHost's servers if you can load the following page (replacing <strong>example.com</strong> with your domain):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/quickstart.html</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMHWJ8000C0SHZE5NRN">View your public site through a proxy</h3>
<p>Once your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file works, your computer will show you how your site looks at DreamHost. If you want also to view your current (public) site, you must use a proxy website.</p>
<p>An example of a proxy site is <a href="https://kproxy.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">kproxy.com</a>. Visit that link in your browser, enter your domain name in the box, and press Enter. The proxy site will use&nbsp;your site's public DNS (not your local <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file) to view the site at your current hosting company.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMJS7YVH6PB5GNREAT5">Comparing the sites</h3>
<p>Viewing your site using a <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file and a proxy site allows you to view both versions of your site for a side-by-side comparison. You can open one browser tab on the migrated site (viewed using your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file) and another on the proxy site (viewed using DNS) to see your current public site.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMJYP2PZS08DT7BPMYV">Making further changes to your site</h3>
<p>During your inspection of the site, you may feel the need to change the setting of something that was outside the scope of the migration service. Please refrain from changing anything that may alter the site's look or behavior since the Professional Services Team must be able to compare the migrated site (at DreamHost) to the live site (at your current host).</p>
<p>If you must update something, document any changes so the Professional Services Team can separate what may have been affected by the migration from subsequent alterations on your end.</p>
