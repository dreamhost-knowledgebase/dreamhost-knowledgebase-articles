<h2 id="h_01HC64VWMHHCG05AFBTYB6XRSV">What is a hosts file?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file is a text file used by your computer that changes where your computer searches for a specific website.&nbsp;For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you visit a website, your computer follows the public DNS records of the internet.</li>
<li>when you edit the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file, you control the DNS records your computer uses.</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows you to view a site on your DreamHost server when the public DNS records are pointed to another company.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMHHCG05AFBTYB6XRSV">A records</h3>
<p>The hosts file uses A records (IP addresses) to locate your site at DreamHost. Each site at DreamHost has two A records for the URL: one for your domain with and one without www. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>111.222.333.444 example.com</li>
<li>111.222.333.444 www.example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article to locate these two records for your website:</p>

<p>The following sections describe how to locate and update your hosts file on different operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMHH95X6R2HNQ0A2HNC">Windows 10</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On most Windows systems, you can find the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file in the following directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc
</pre>
</div>
<p>Notepad is a basic text editing program that is already installed on Windows. To open the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file with Notepad, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <span class="text-section">Start</span> menu.</li>
<li>Start typing the word 'notepad', and it will display the icon.</li>
<li>Right-click on the <span class="text-object">Notepad</span> option and choose <span class="text-object">Run as administrator</span>.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You may receive a pop-up message titled <span class="text-object">User Access Control</span> asking, <span class="text-object">Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC?</span> Click <strong>Yes</strong>. This opens a blank Notepad file.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Click the <span class="text-section">File &gt; Open...</span> menu option in the top left of this blank file.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="text-object">This PC</span> in the Explorer window and then to the <span class="text-object">C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc</span> directory.

<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMH7CTWVA0P70ZVV8Q4">WordPress Professional Services migrations</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This section explains how to view your WordPress site (at DreamHost) if it was migrated by the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004182807">Professional Services Team</a>. This section only applies to NON-DreamPress migrations.</p>
<p>Locate and edit your computer's <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file as described above. With this migration process, you must add a third line of text for the MySQL server. For example, if your site were <strong>example.com</strong>, you would add these lines to the bottom of your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">111.111.111.111 example.com
111.111.111.111 www.example.com
222.222.222.222 mysql.example.com</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p><strong>Making further changes to your site</strong></p>
<p>Please refrain from changing anything that may alter the site's look or behavior since the Professional Services Team must be able to compare the migrated site (at DreamHost) to the live site (at your current host).</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This section explains how to compare your DreamHost site to your live website.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMH5F69C3AT5SP08K91">Confirming the 'hosts' file is working</h3>
<p>You can confirm you are loading the migrated site from DreamHost's servers if you can load the following page (replacing <strong>example.com</strong> with your domain):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/quickstart.html</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HC64VWMHWJ8000C0SHZE5NRN">View your public site through a proxy</h3>
<p>Once your <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file works, your computer will show you how your site looks at DreamHost. If you want to also view your current (public) site, you must use a proxy website.</p>
<p>An example of a proxy site is <a href="https://kproxy.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">kproxy.com</a>. The proxy site will use your site's public DNS (not your local <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file) to view the site at your current hosting company.&nbsp;Viewing your site using a <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file and a proxy site allows you to view both versions of your site for a side-by-side comparison.&nbsp;</p>
