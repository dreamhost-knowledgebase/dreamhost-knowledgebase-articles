<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A Dedicated server is a server that is completely dedicated to your data alone. This means no other DreamHost customers have any access or share any resources with your sites on that server.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers several types of hosting plans. You can see details of each along with a comparison on the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Hosting</a> article. With all other types of hosting, your data is on a machine with other users.</p>
<p>Dedicated servers are premium machines best for high-performance websites that require dedicated resources to run them efficiently. For further information, please view the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/dedicated/">Dedicated Hosting</a> page on the main website.</p>
