<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>An <a href="http://www.htaccess-guide.com/">.htaccess file</a> controls how Apache interacts with your site. When an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file is placed in your domain’s directory, the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file is detected and executed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server">Apache web server</a>.</p>
<p>An <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file is commonly used for the following:</p>

<p>Using an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file on your website is unlikely to cause any problems. However, it is possible for errors to occur if the rules entered into the file are incorrect which may cause your site to suddenly display a 500 error. If something like this occurs, you can comment out the rules/lines you have just added by placing a ‘#’ in front of each line. Repeat this until you find the line causing the error.</p>

<h2><span id="Creating_an_.htaccess_file">Creating an .htaccess file on your DreamHost web server</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can create an .htaccess directly on your web server using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613107-List-of-FTP-client-software">FTP client</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. View the following articles for instructions on how to use either option to create the file:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you're using an FTP client, make sure it has been configured to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-do-I-show-hidden-files-on-my-FTP-client-">show hidden files</a>. This is necessary since the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file begins with a period.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Make sure that when you create the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file you do <strong>NOT</strong> add a file extension. This file should only be titled <strong>.htaccess</strong> with no extension.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>What permissions should the file have?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>644 permissions are usually fine for an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file. When you create the file on the server, it should already have these permissions set, so there is most likely nothing to change.</p>
</div>
<h2>Where to put your .htaccess file?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Generally, you put the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file in your website's main directory. However, the location ultimately depends on what you're attempting to do with the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file.</p>
<p>The <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file can control behavior for every directory under the folder it resides in. For this reason it can also be in your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">user's home directory</a>. Again, it depends on what you're using the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file for.</p>
</div>
<h2>Do I need to reload my server or website after creating my .htaccess file?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file (and any changes that you make to it) should be reflected on the live site immediately. You do not need to reload your site's Apache service, although external caching services such as Cloudflare might need their caches flushed.</p>
