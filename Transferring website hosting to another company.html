<p>It's important to obtain a textual copy of the DNS records for your domains in case your new host needs any of them.</p>
<p>To obtain your DNS records:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the ‘DNS’ link below the domain.</li>
<li>Scroll down on the ‘Manage Domain’ page that appears to view all non-editable DreamHost DNS records and also any custom DNS records that you may have created.</li>
<li>Copy all the DNS records in case your new hosting company requires you to replicate them on their servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view the following articles for further details on DNS at DreamHost:</p>

<h2><span id="Pointing_your_DNS_to_the_new_hosting_company">Confirming everything is backed up</span></h2>
<p>Before you point your DNS to the new hosting company, make sure you have backed up the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web files via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089918-How-do-I-backup-my-entire-account-">Account Backup</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a></li>
<li>Database via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089918-How-do-I-backup-my-entire-account-">Account Backup</a>, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221686207-SSH-Backing-up-your-database">Command Line</a></li>

<li>Copy of the DNS records</li>
</ul>
<h2>Uploading your data to the new hosting company</h2>
<p>Now that everything is backed up, you must log into your new hosting company's panel and upload all of your site's content. Check with your new host for instructions on how to upload your data within their system.</p>

<h3>Option #1 — If your domain is registered at DreamHost and you want ALL records hosted at the new company</h3>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>NOTE: Updating your nameservers points <strong>ALL</strong> of your DNS records to the new hosting company. This means all email, website, and custom DNS records will be hosted at the new company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, all you need to do is update your nameservers to point them to your new hosting provider. View the following article for instructions on how to change your nameservers:</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>If this is your only domain on your account, you do <strong>NOT</strong> need to maintain a hosting plan. A hosting plan is only necessary if you wish to host a domain and its content on DreamHost servers. If this is your only domain, make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203372007-Cancel-Account">cancel your hosting plan</a>. Your DNS will continue to point to your new hosting company.</p>

<h4>DNS propagation time</h4>
<p>Each record created requires its own time for the DNS to resolve. You can check the progress of the record at a site such as this:</p>

<h3>Option #2 — If your domain is registered at DreamHost and you only want the website hosted at the new company while keeping email hosted at DreamHost</h3>
<p>If you want your site to point away from DreamHost while keeping your email hosted at DreamHost, you must create custom DNS records. Contact your new host to obtain the correct IP addresses to point to. Then view the following article for instructions on how to create A records for your site.</p>
