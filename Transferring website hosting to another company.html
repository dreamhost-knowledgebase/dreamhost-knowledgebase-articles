<p>If you need to move your domain hosting to another hosting provider, there are several steps you must take to ensure that your data has been correctly backed up and your DNS is adjusted. The following information describes the necessary steps you must take to transfer website hosting.</p>

<ul>
<li>website files</li>
<li>database</li>
<li>email</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subheader">Step 2 — Find your DNS records</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's important to obtain a textual copy of the DNS records for your domains in case your new host needs any of them.</p>
<p>To obtain your DNS records:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!/grid-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a>&nbsp;page.</li>
<li>Open the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span> page:

<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-manage-websites-dns-settings.png" alt="DNS Settings" width="222" height="205" /></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001294366#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">Grid view</a>, click the 'vertical 3 dots' button under your domain. From the popout menu, click the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span>&nbsp;link.</li>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001294366#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">List view</a>, click the 'vertical 3 dots' button to the right of your domain.&nbsp;From the popout menu, click the <span class="text-link">DNS Settings</span>&nbsp;link.
<dl>
<dd><em>The domain's DNS records display.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy all the DNS records in case your new hosting company requires you to replicate them on their servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view the following articles for further details on DNS at DreamHost:</p>

</ul>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 class="subheader">Step 3 — Confirm everything is backed up</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before you point your DNS to the new hosting company, make sure you have backed up the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web files via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089918-Back-up-an-account-in-the-panel">Account Backup</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a></li>
<li>Database via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089918-Back-up-an-account-in-the-panel">Account Backup</a>, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>, or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221686207-SSH-Backing-up-your-database">Command Line</a></li>
<li>Emails via&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089918-Back-up-an-account-in-the-panel">Account Backup</a></li>
<li>Copy of the DNS records</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 class="subheader">Step 4 — Upload your data to the new hosting company</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/transfer-site-to-new-host-02.svg" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that everything is backed up, you must log into your new hosting company's panel and upload all of your site's content. Check with your new host for instructions on how to upload your data within their system.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="subheader">Step 5 — Point your DNS to the new hosting company</h2>

<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Option #1 — If your domain is registered at DreamHost and you want ALL records hosted at the new company</h3>
<p>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, all you need to do is update your nameservers to point them to your new hosting provider. Updating your nameservers points <strong>ALL</strong> of your DNS records to the new hosting company. This means all email, website, and custom DNS records will be hosted at the new company. View the following article for instructions on how to change your nameservers:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If this is your only domain on your account, you do <strong>NOT</strong> need to maintain a hosting plan. A hosting plan is only necessary if you wish to host a domain and its content on DreamHost servers. If this is your only domain, make sure to <a href="/hc/en-us/sections/203372007-Close-Account">close your hosting plan</a>. Your DNS will continue to point to your new hosting company.</p>

<h4>DNS propagation time</h4>
<p>Each record created requires its own time for the DNS to resolve. You can use the following links to check the progress of the record:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatsmydns.net</a> — A popular site that checks DNS records around the world.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360055964552-Viewing-your-DreamHost-DNS-records" target="_self">Viewing your DreamHost DNS records</a> — Use DreamHost's DNS propagation checker in the panel.</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Option #2 — If your domain is registered at DreamHost and you only want the website hosted at the new company while keeping email hosted at DreamHost</h3>
<p>If you want your site to point away from DreamHost while keeping your email hosted at DreamHost, you must create custom DNS records. Contact your new host to obtain the correct IP addresses to point to. Then view the following article for instructions on how to create A records for your site.</p>
