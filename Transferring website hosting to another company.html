<h3>Option #1 — If your domain is registered at DreamHost and you want ALL records hosted at the new company</h3>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60"></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>NOTE: Updating your nameservers points <strong>ALL</strong> of your DNS records to the new hosting company. This means all email, website, and custom DNS records will be hosted at the new company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, all you need to do is update your nameservers to point them to your new hosting provider. View the following article for instructions on how to change your nameservers:</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>If this is your only domain on your account, you do <strong>NOT</strong> need to maintain a hosting plan. A hosting plan is only necessary if you wish to host a domain and its content on DreamHost servers. If this is your only domain, make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203372007-Cancel-Account">cancel your hosting plan</a>. Your DNS will continue to point to your new hosting company.</p>

<h3>Option #2 — If your domain is registered at DreamHost and you only want the website hosted at the new company while keeping email hosted at DreamHost</h3>
<p>If you want your site to point away from DreamHost while keeping your email hosted at DreamHost, you must create custom DNS records.
