<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are receiving 301 errors saying "repository has been moved permanently to [some other url]", then check these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you haven't created your repository called "svn" or inside of a directory called "svn".</li>
<li>Make sure you don't have .htaccess rules above the subversion directory that are causing any kind of re-write (like WordPress). This includes having DreamHost automatically add 'www.' to your URL.

<h2><span id="File_ownership_problems">File ownership problems</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On DreamHost servers, Subversion runs as the <strong>dhapache</strong> user. If you create a file, it is owned by <strong>yourusername</strong>, not <strong>dhapache</strong> and subversion can't read it. It is pretty easy to have this happen.</p>
<p>Once dhapache has lost ownership of the file, your repository becomes unmodifiable and your users will get "permission denied" errors when they try to commit.</p>
<h3><span id="Fixing_ownership_problems">Fixing ownership problems</span></h3>
<p>If your repository becomes corrupted through bad ownership, try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.svn&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subversion</a> page.</li>
<li>To the far right of your repository, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Add a new user and password.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Update my repository now!</strong> button to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the process of adding a new user, the DreamHost job will recursively change file ownership for the whole repository back to <strong>dhapache</strong>.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, you may have to dump, recreate and reload your repository.</p>
<p>Below are how the permissions should look on your primary /svn directory under your username:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">drwxr-xr-x  username pgXXXXXXX svn
</pre>
</div>
<p>In that directory is your Subversion project. Those files should appear with the following permissions:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">drwxrwxr-x dhapache pgXXXXXXX mysvnprojectID
-rw-r----- username dhapache  mysvnprojectID.access
-rw-r----- username dhapache  mysvnprojectID.passwd
</pre>
</div>
