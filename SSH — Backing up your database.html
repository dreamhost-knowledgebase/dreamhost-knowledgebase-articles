<h2>Running the command</h2>
<p>At this point you should have your database credentials and are logged into your server in a terminal. Make sure you're in your user's home directory:</p>

<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cd ~</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Once there, run the following command. Make sure to change the username, password, yourMySQLHostname, and dbname to the correct credentials. </p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mysqldump --opt --user=<strong>username</strong> --password=<strong>password</strong> --host=<strong>yourMySQLHostname</strong> <strong>dbname</strong> &gt; nameofyourbackup.sql</span></pre>
</div>
<p>You can use any name for "nameofyourbackup.sql" – just make sure it ends with .sql.</p>
