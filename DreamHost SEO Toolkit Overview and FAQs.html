<h2 id="h_01HAMHWP4NBNFPHGTGMK0J2VAN">FAQs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NHP8FE2DN3EMEXQ57">Does the DreamHost SEO Toolkit automatically increase my SEO score?</h3>
<p>The DreamHost SEO Toolkit by design is a <em>do-it-yourself</em> tool. While it helps you analyze your site and gives recommendations, tasks, and instructions in order for you to optimize your site, it does <em>not</em> make these changes for you.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't mean DreamHost won't help you with resolving any issues with your account. The DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">support</a> team is available to help you with questions you may have or and any issues you may encounter when using the platform.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NVDZ139XD61KTN2QQ">I'm already using a different SEO tool — can I import that data into the DreamHost SEO Toolkit?</h3>
<p>The DreamHost SEO Toolkit uses a customized system for tracking and managing SEO data. Because of this, data from other SEO tools cannot be imported into the SEO Toolkit.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NRT9FADSTN80FWMHH">Do I need to use WordPress to take advantage of the DreamHost SEO Toolkit?</h3>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The SEO Toolkit for WordPress websites is installed as a WordPress plugin, and new versions will be available regularly. Ensure that you apply updates when they are available. View the following article for more information on upgrading WordPress plugins:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, be aware that the DreamHost SEO Toolkit plugin requires a Gutenberg-compatible WordPress editor.</p>
</div>
<p>The DreamHost SEO Toolkit is available for both WordPress and non-WordPress websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress websites access the SEO Toolkit from the website's own WordPress dashboard.</li>
<li>Non-WordPress websites access the SEO Toolkit from within the DreamHost panel.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Non-WordPress websites may need to be manually updated in order to improve the score shown in the DreamHost SEO Toolkit.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NRXSFGGJPK59XYMPY">Can I use the DreamHost SEO Toolkit with Remixer?</h3>
<p>No. The DreamHost SEO Toolkit cannot be used with Remixer websites.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NY31BEVASBDQ25A9V">If I move my website to another URL, will the DreamHost SEO Toolkit data transfer over?</h3>
<p>No. SEO data, backlink information, and traffic are specific to the domain currently in use, and SEO data does not carry over from one URL to another. When changing the domain name of a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360049679412-Changing-the-domain-of-a-WordPress-site" target="_self">WordPress</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115004353927-Changing-the-name-of-a-DreamPress-domain" target="_self">DreamPress</a> website with the panel tool, any SEO progress made is permanently reset, but changes made to the website itself will remain intact.</p>
<p>DreamHost recommends only adding the DreamHost SEO Toolkit once your domain name is finalized.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NGD53484195KXHVN5">When can I expect to see results in search engines?</h3>
<p>While the DreamHost SEO Toolkit will scan your website and provide you with details on how to improve your site's SEO score, it does not automatically make any changes to your website. Instead, it provides easy-to-follow steps and tasks in order to improve your search engine rankings, and by following these steps, your SEO score will improve over time.</p>
<p>It takes some time at first to get acquainted with certain SEO concepts, but it is absolutely doable, and the DreamHost SEO Toolkit is built for users who are not experienced with SEO. DreamHost recommends checking and working on your website's SEO at least once per week. The sooner you start the process, the sooner you will start to see results.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HAMHWP4NMSRG3SDMTS6D10MN">Will my competitors know that I'm tracking them?</h3>
<p>No. Only you know who you’re tracking.</p>
<p>Our competitor tracking feature lets you keep up with your competition without giving them any hint of what you are doing.</p>
