<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Web servers have a directory named <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> used to store temporary files. Many programs use this <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory for writing temporary data and generally remove the data when it is no longer needed. Otherwise the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory is cleared when the server restarts.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On shared servers, the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory is shared among all customers on the server. On a private server, the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory is not shared but is limited in size to 128MB.</p>
<p>When the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory becomes full, some programs stop working. For example, it is no longer be possible to upload a file to a site since there is no room in the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> folder to store the temporary file while it's uploading.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To maintain control of the temporary storage for files and add security for things such as sessions, you can configure the software to use any directory you want for temporary storage. It is often desirable to make this directory within your own user space (outside the web accessible directory). For example, create a <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory in the following location. Make sure to change <span class="text-object">username</span> to your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access" target="_self">Shell user</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Here you can control the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory while your files are protected from view by others on the server. You would control this directory based on the programming language your site is using. For example, if your site is using PHP, view the following link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.upload-tmp-dir">PHP upload_tmp_dir</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>VPS users often see their <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory filling up. For example, you may see a <strong>Failed to write</strong> when attempting to upload to your site. This is because it's only 128MB by default. If this is an issue, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reboot your server. When the server restarts, the <span class="text-object">/tmp</span> directory is automatically cleared.</li>
