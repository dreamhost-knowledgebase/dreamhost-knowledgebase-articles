<h2>Clients to use to upload your site</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When your site is built and ready to go, you can then upload your files to DreamHost to place them on the web server in order to display your site.</p>
<p>This can be done by using an FTP client to upload your files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>FTP Client</strong> — <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> , <a href="https://cyberduck.io/?l=en">Cyberduck</a>, CuteFTP, and so on, depending on your OS. Using a fully functioning FTP client such as these is the recommended way to connect to your web server.</li>
<li>
<strong>File Manager&nbsp;</strong>— Visit <a href="https://files.dreamhost.com" target="_self" rel="undefined">files.dreamhost.com</a> to connect to your site using the panel's file manager. This is the FTP client option available within your DreamHost panel.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>There are many other FTP client software packages. Please visit the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613107-List-of-FTP-client-software" target="_self" rel="undefined">List of FTP clients</a> article for more information.</p>

<h2>Uploading website files in an FTP client</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost recommends you use an FTP client to upload your files to DreamHost. You can download and use any FTP client of your choice (see the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613107-List-of-FTP-client-software">List of FTP clients</a> article for more information).</p>
<p>The following is an example of how the Filezilla interface appears:</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p><strong>FTP SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>It's highly recommended you only use port 22 with an SFTP or Shell user when connecting as using port 21 with a legacy FTP user is insecure. View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001051531-FTP-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTP Security</a> article and <a href="#port" target="_self">Port</a> section below for further details.</p>

<p>Use the following FTP account login values when prompted:</p>
<h3>Host/Server Name</h3>
<p>You can use either of the following:</p>
<h4>
<strong>SITE URL</strong> (without <span class="text-object">https://www</span>)</h4>
<p>For example, if your site is <strong>https://www.example.com</strong> then just use <strong>example.com</strong> to log in to your FTP client.</p>
<h4><strong>Server URL</strong></h4>
<p>The server URL is the name of your server followed by <strong>.dreamhost.com</strong>.</p>

<p>Your hosting plan and Machine (server) name is listed at the top. In this example, the server is named <span class="text-object">philip-livingston</span>, so the server address would be <strong>philip-livingston.dreamhost.com</strong>.</p>
<h3>Username / Login</h3>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Please note that your Panel WebID is NOT the FTP username.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the username used to log into your FTP account. You can find this information in the email DreamHost sent you when you signed up or created the FTP user account. You can also locate the username in the panel by following these steps:</p>

</ol>
<h3>Password</h3>
<p>This is the password to log into your FTP account only. Please note this is NOT the same password you use for your Panel. Allow up to 15 minutes for it to update in the system before it’s active.</p>
<p>See the following article for the latest information on how to reset your password:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215877208-Change-password-Website-users-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change password (Website users)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="port">Port</h3>
<p>Check the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FTP Users &amp; Files</a> page to see if your user is an FTP/SFTP/SHELL user. Click the <strong>Login info</strong> button next to the username to view the type. SFTP and SHELL users (the default options) use port 22.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>To ensure a secure connection when connecting to your server, make sure to use port 22. This is also known as connecting via SFTP.&nbsp; Using port 21 with a legacy FTP user is never recommended as the connection is insecure.</p>

</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>After you have uploaded your website, you will need to point the site's DNS to DreamHost to make it live. See the following article for information on the process:</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you uploaded your site and everything looks like it transferred normally, but you only see a "Parent directory" on the page, then chances are you uploaded your files to the wrong folder, or you uploaded your files to the wrong FTP user account. Please check and retry.</p>
