<h2>Flagging messages as spam</h2>
<p>If spam has found its way into your inbox, you can simply flag it as spam. The system starts learning that similar messages are also likely spam.</p>
<p>Please note that clicking the Spam button does not teach your specific email address what is and what is not spam. Clicking the Spam button only sends the data off to Vade so they may continue to develop their filtering system for the public as a whole.</p>
<p>So, if a large amount of users mark an address as spam, Vade will eventually update their filters to tag that as spam for all users.</p>

<h2>Flagging messages that are not spam</h2>
<p>Occasionally, the spam filtering service may flag an incoming message as spam when it actually isn't. By flagging a message as "not spam", the service will learn to avoid flagging similar messages in the future.</p>
<p>To flag a message as not spam:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Log into webmail and select the message from your "Spam" folder.
<dl>
