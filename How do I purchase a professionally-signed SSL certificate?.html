<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article only explains how to purchase a Professionally-Signed SSL certificate in your DreamHost panel. This type of certificate&nbsp;costs $15/year and is signed by Sectigo, displaying a certificate seal of trust on your site.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 references Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificate issued prior to this date references Comodo. Both names&nbsp;<a href="https://sectigo.com/comodo" target="_self">refer to the same company</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This type of certificate is recommended for eCommerce sites, customer login areas, or any other site that transmit sensitive information.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before you begin the process to purchase an SSL certificate, make sure you have already created a confirmation email address on your domain. This email may be necessary to finalize the purchase.</p>
<p>This email must be an address on your domain. For example, if your website is <strong>example.com</strong>, make sure you have already created one of the following addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">admin@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">administrator@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">hostmaster@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">postmaster@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">webmaster@example.com</span></li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to create an email address:</p>

<p>Your email can be hosted at another company, you just need to make sure that one of the addresses above is active and able to receive email.</p>

<p>If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview" target="_self">Nameservers</a> are <strong>NOT</strong> hosted at DreamHost, you must add CAA records at your current DNS hosting company before adding an SSL certificate in the DreamHost panel.

<li>You must fill in ALL of the fields (including the 'Organization name') in order to successfully proceed to the next step. If you don't have an organization name, then enter your first and last name. 'Street 2' and 'Street 3' are optional fieldsâ€”you can leave those blank if your address does not include any of this info (such as an apt. #).</li>

<p><strong>Confirmation address</strong></p>
<p>This must be an email on your domain.&nbsp;Make sure one of the emails listed in that dropdown has been created on your domain and you are able to receive mail with it.

<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify. So it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h3>Email from DreamHost</h3>
<p>You'll soon receive an email from support@dreamhost.com at the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order. This is just a confirmation of your purchase, but it may also ask you to click a link to verify your contact info.</p>
<h3>Email from Sectigo</h3>
<p>You may also receive a second email from Sectigo. This is part of the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001402683-What-is-the-DCV-process-">DCV process</a> to verify your domain.

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At this point you have only purchased the Sectigo certificate. It is <strong>NOT</strong> installed yet. You can see on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page that it's listed as 'pending'.</p>
<dl>

</dl>
<p>When you click the <strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>button to the right, you'll see a 'Temporary' certificate is currently installed, which can viewed under the <span class="text-object">Current Certificate</span> tab:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/ssl-panel-sectigo-july-2020_05.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>A temporary certificate is only active while your Sectigo certificate is in the process of installing. Once installed, your Sectigo certificate takes its place and becomes the only active certificate on your domain.</p>
<p>Once the Sectigo certificate is active, the following displays on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page to the right of the domain.</p>

<h2><span id="forcing">Forcing your site to load HTTPS by default</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in <span class="text-object">https</span> before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (<span class="text-object">https</span>).</p>
