<p>On November 1, 2018, Comodo announced that the company is rebranding to Sectigo. For more information about this, please see the following announcement at Sectigo's website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sectigo.com/sectigo-story-faq">Comodo CA Is Now Sectigo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 will reference Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificates issued prior to that will still reference Comodo. These are still the same company, and the only difference is the name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This type of certificate is recommended for e-commerce sites, customer login areas, or any other site that transmit sensitive information.</p>
<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<p>Before you begin the process to purchase an SSL certificate, make sure you have already created a confirmation email address on your domain. This email may be necessary to finalize the purchase.</p>
<p>This email must be an address on your domain. For example, if your website is 'example.com', make sure you have already created one of the following addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>admin@example.com</li>
<li>administrator@example.com</li>
<li>hostmaster@example.com</li>
<li>postmaster@example.com</li>
<li>webmaster@example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to create an email address:</p>

<li>Enter your personal and website information.
<ul>
<li>You must fill in ALL of the fields (including the 'Organization name') in order to successfully proceed to the next step. If you don't have an organization name, then enter your first and last name. 'Street 2' and 'Street 3' are optional fields—you can leave those blank if your address does not include any of this info (such as an apt. #).</li>
<li>This information is used to generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that is used to generate your new professionally-signed SSL certificate.</li>

<div class="alert-content">
<p><strong>Confirmation address</strong></p>
<p>This must be an email on your domain. Make sure one of the emails listed in that dropdown has been created on your domain and you are able to receive mail with it. If it does not exist, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217139407-Email-quickstart-guide">create this email first</a> before continuing.</p>
<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify. So it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h2>What happens after you purchase it?</h2>
<h3>Email from DreamHost</h3>
<p>You'll soon receive an email from support@dreamhost.com at the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order. This is just a confirmation of your purchase, but it may also ask you to click a link to verify your contact info.</p>
<h3>Email from Sectigo</h3>
<p>You may also receive a second email from Sectigo. This is part of the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001402683-What-is-the-DCV-process-">DCV process</a> to verify your domain. This is a last option in the DCV process, so it's possible you never receive this email. If you do receive this email from Sectigo, proceed through the steps to complete the verification of your domain.</p>

<h2><span id="Installing_the_Comodo_certificate_on_your_website">Installing the Sectigo certificate on your website</span></h2>
<p>At this point you have only purchased the Sectigo certificate. It is <strong>NOT</strong> installed yet. You can see on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page that it's listed as 'pending'.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_comodo_05.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you click the <strong>Settings </strong>button to the right, you'll see a 'Temporary' certificate is currently installed.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_comodo_06.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>This temporary certificate will only remain active while your Sectigo certificate is in the process of installing. Once installed, your Sectigo certificate will take its place and become the only active certificate on your domain.</p>
<p>Once the Sectigo certificate is active, the following will display on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page to the right of the domain.</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_comodo_07.png" /></p>
<h2>Test if the SSL certificate is working</h2>
<p>The certificate is now installed on your domain. Visit the secure URL of your website at:</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://</strong>example.com</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" alt="Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see the browser bar shows a lock icon confirming the connection is secure.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you just installed the certificate, you may need to wait a few hours for it to update online.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS be default</h2>
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in 'https' before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (https).</p>

</ul>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>After installing your certificate, you may find that your browser is still showing an insecure warning when visiting the HTTPS version of your URL. There are a few reasons this could occur. Please view the following article for instructions on how to resolve this issue.</p>
