<p>Make sure the VPS has enough space to migrate all of your users and domains. If there is insufficient space on the VPS, the migration fails and you may not be able to log in to the private server. You can check how much space you need by looking at the "Disk Used" column of the 'Manage Users' page.</p>

<p>Moving a website user and domain to a new server does not affect email. This is because email is on a completely different mail server. Your email will continue to function normally.</p>
