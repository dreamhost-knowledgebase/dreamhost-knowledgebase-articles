<p>Message filters are special rules you can create which automatically perform actions on incoming email. This is a simple way to make incoming email easier to sort and categorize. For example, you could label all email messages from your boss as “Important”. The filter could then add the word IMPORTANT to the subject of emails with <span class="text-object">boss@example.com</span> in the from field.</p>
<p>Filters can be created only for fully-hosted email addresses. Another option is to enable <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214984738-Anti-spam-overview">anti-spam</a> filters in the panel. If you do so, the anti-spam filters are applied first, then your custom message filters are applied. You can also add filters on your specific mail client such as Thunderbird, Outlook, or Gmail.</p>
<p>This article describes how to add custom filters in your DreamHost panel.</p>
