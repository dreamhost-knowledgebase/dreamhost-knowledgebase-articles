<p>Message filters are special rules you can create which automatically perform actions on incoming email. This is a simple way to make incoming email easier to sort and categorize. For example, you could label all email messages from your boss as “Important”. The filter could then add the word IMPORTANT to the subject of emails with boss@example.com in the from field.</p>
<p>Filters can be created only for fully-hosted email addresses. Another option is to enable <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214984738-Anti-spam-overview">anti-spam</a> filters in the panel. If you do so, the anti-spam filters are applied first, then your custom message filters are applied. You can also add filters on your specific mail client such as Thunderbird, Outlook, or Gmail.</p>
<p>This article describes how to add custom filters in your DreamHost panel.</p>

<h2>How does the 'execute' option work?</h2>
<p>The last option in the filter is to set 'execute and continue' or 'execute and stop'. Choosing this setting affects how forwarding works. Here are a few examples:</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>In these examples, email is being sent to admin@example.com while forwarding to forward@example.com.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Example #1 (execute and stop)</h3>
<p>Let's say you have two filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, forward emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> to admin@example.com and then stop.</li>
<li>Finally, add <strong>(execute and stop)</strong> to the subject of emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> and then stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the original email is sent to admin@example.com, it correctly forwards to forward@example.com without any text being added to the subject.</p>
<p>The second rule is never triggered so the email never arrives at admin@example.com.</p>
<h3>Example #2 (execute and stop)</h3>
<p>This example reverses the two rules above::</p>
<ul>
<li>First, add <strong>(execute and stop)</strong> to the subject of emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> and then stop.</li>
<li>Finally, forward emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> to admin@example.com and then stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the original email is sent to admin@example.com, <strong>it does not arrive</strong>, but the subject text is added correctly.</p>
<p>The second rule then forwards to forward@example.com in addition to adding the (execute and stop) text to the subject.</p>
<h3>Example #3 (execute and continue)</h3>
<p>This is the same as example #1, except the last rule is now 'execute and continue'.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, forward a copy emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> to admin@example.com and then continue.</li>
<li>Finally, add <strong>(execute and continue)</strong> to the subject of emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> and then continue.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the original email is sent to admin@example.com, it forwards to forward@example.com, but the (execute and continue) text <strong>is not</strong> added to the subject.</p>
<p>The email also arrives at the original address of admin@example.com <strong>with</strong> the (execute and continue) text added.</p>
<h3>Example #4 (execute and continue)</h3>
<p>This is the same as example #2, except the last rule is now 'execute and continue'.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, add <strong>(execute and continue)</strong> to the subject of emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> and then continue.</li>
<li>Finally, forward a copy emails with <strong>Test</strong> in the <strong>subject</strong> to admin<em>@example.com</em> and then continue.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the original email is sent to admin@example.com, it arrives with (execute and continue) added to the subject line.</p>
<p>The email also arrives at forward@example.com with the subject text added.</p>
