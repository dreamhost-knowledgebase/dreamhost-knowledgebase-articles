<p>You can change the domain name for your WordPress site any time you like, but&nbsp;there are a few important settings that must me made in order to make the switch.</p>
<p>Make sure to carefully follow the steps below to ensure it's done properly.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Introduction">Several reasons&nbsp;to change the URL</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following are instructions for moving a WordPress installation from one URL to a different one. There are different cases for moving a WordPress install, as shown below.</p>
<h3>Case #1&nbsp;— Moving from a subdirectory</h3>
<p>The first case is when a WordPress site moves from a sub-directory to its parent domain. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move from <strong>https://example.com/blog</strong><br />to</li>
<li><strong>https://example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you've already moved your domain to a new URL, you are not able to log in since WordPress is configured to use the old URL.</p>
<h3>Case #2 — Adding or removing www</h3>
<p>Another reason to update your URLs is if you need to add or remove www from your domain. For example, if you're using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215873088-Cloudflare-overview">Cloudflare</a>&nbsp;with DreamHost, you need to add www to your domain. So if it was previously&nbsp;<strong>example.com</strong>, you would change it to&nbsp;<strong>www.example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>After adjusting the URL, you may also see a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215457387#When_removing_.22www.22_breaks_WordPress">browser redirect error</a> when viewing your site. It may say "Too many redirects" or "The page isn't redirecting properly".</p>
<h3>Case #3 — Adding 'https' to the URL</h3>
<p>If you're using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218428687-How-do-I-use-an-SSL-certificate-with-WordPress-">SSL certificate</a>, the first part of the URL changes from 'http' to 'https'.&nbsp;If you've already made this change, you are not able to log in&nbsp;since WordPress is configured to use the old URL.</p>
<h3>Case #4 — Moving to a new domain</h3>
<p>The last&nbsp;case is when a WordPress site moves from one fully hosted domain to a different one. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move from <span class="text-object">http://example.com</span><br />to</li>
<li><span class="text-object">http://dreamhost.com</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If this option applies to your site, view the following article for full instructions on moving a WordPress install to a different domain</p>

<p>The following two options explain how to change your HOME and SITE URL so you gain immediate access to your WordPress site and dashboard.</p>
<p>After logging in, you should then use a plugin to update all URLs in your database to the new URL. View the following article for full instructions:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

</div>
<h3>Option 1&nbsp;– <span id="Changing_the_URL_using_phpMyAdmin">Changing the HOME and SITE URL using phpMyAdmin</span></h3>
<p>If you've already made any of the changes above, you're not able to log into your dashboard. You can instead use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a> to update the HOME and SITE URLs.</p>
<p>Visit the following article for more information on how to log into phpMyAdmin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/221610868-phpMyAdmin-Finding-your-login-credentials">Finding your phpMyAdmin login credentials</a></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Open phpMyAdmin.</li>
<li>Click your database in the left pane. Several tables appear below it. Click on your wp_options table.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/03_Change_wordpress_site_url_phpmyadmin.fw.png" alt="03 Change wordpress site url phpmyadmin.fw.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Locate the <span class="text-object">siteurl</span> and <span class="text-object">home</span> rows. Click the <span class="text-object">pencil</span> icon next to each to edit.<br />
<dl>
<dd><em>When you scroll over these options, "browse" will appear.</em></dd>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/04_Change_wordpress_site_url_phpmyadmin.fw.png" alt="04 Change wordpress site url phpmyadmin.fw.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <span class="text-object">pencil</span> icon next to each to edit.<br />
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/04.5_Change_wordpress_site_url_phpmyadmin.fw.png" alt="04.5 Change wordpress site url phpmyadmin.fw.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Alter the URL by typing in a new one.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Go</strong> button to save the settings. Do this for both the 'siteurl' and 'home' options.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now be able to log into your site at&nbsp;<strong>example.com/wp-login.php</strong>.</p>
<p>Although this gives you access to your site, any former URLs in your database are still using the old URL. You should now use a plugin to update all URLs in your database to the new URL. View the following article for full instructions:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Option 2 –&nbsp;<span id="Changing_the_URL_in_your_wp-config.php_file">Changing the URLs in your wp-config.php file</span></h3>
<p>You can also change the URLs in your <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> file. This is a little easier than editing your database and will give you immediate access to your site.</p>

<p>The following assumes your Home and Site URL should be <strong>example.com</strong>.</p>

<pre class="prebox">define('WP_HOME','https://<span class="code-highlight">example.com</span>');
define('WP_SITEURL','https://<span class="code-highlight">example.com</span>');</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>If you visit your site now, you'll see you can log in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although this gives you immediate access to your site, the database is still not configured to use the correct HOME and SITE URL.&nbsp;You should now use a plugin to update all URLs in your database to the new URL. View the following article for full instructions:</p>

<h2>Verifying the new HOME and SITE URL</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you used options #1 above, the HOME and SITE URLs were updated in the database. You can confirm your site is now using the correct URLs in your dashboard.</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Log into your WordPress Dashboard.

<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you used Option #2, the database did not update your HOME and SITE URL. On the 'Settings &gt; General' page you'll see the entries are grayed out with the values you entered in your <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> file:</p>
<img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-12_3rdparty_wordpress_home-site-url.png" />
<p>You should now use a plugin to update all URLs in your database to the new URL. View the following article for full instructions:</p>
