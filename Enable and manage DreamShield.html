<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost offers a paid security service called <span class="text-product">DreamShield</span> that you can enable through the panel, which allows you to scan your website for malware. Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="text-product">DreamShield</span> Malware Remover service is an add-on that you can use on any domain (or subdomain) you like to ensure it is free of malicious code that could potentially compromise sensitive information.</li>
<li>When you add <span class="text-product">DreamShield</span>, it immediately runs a scan on your site and will automatically scan it on a daily basis after that.</li>
<li>You are notified via email if <span class="text-product">DreamShield</span> finds any issues. Your panel also displays this information.</li>
<li>If the site is clean, your panel shows this information. An email is also sent that lets you know your site is clean.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following describes how to add or remove <span class="text-product">DreamShield</span> to a domain using the DreamHost panel.</p>

<h2 id="h_01H9KP3C0FQSSV7V83TR00P96A">What do I do if DreamShield finds any issues with my website?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When DreamShield completes a scan of your website, an email is sent to you with the results and includes any issues that are found. The email also provides appropriate next steps to take (including links) in order to correct any intrusions or other threats.</p>
<p>Here are a few links to popular articles to help you address any issues in the event that DreamShield detects any problems on your website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/sections/203242577-Hacked-Sites">Hacked Sites category page</a></li>

<h2 id="h_01H9KP3C0F8K0JDSVJF5W6A880">Testing your site after it's been cleaned</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've cleaned your site of any compromised code, you may want to confirm it's now secure. DreamShield runs once per day, so it will automatically inform you of any issues the next time it runs.</p>
<p>However, if you'd like an immediate scan, please <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">submit a support ticket</a> with the topic set to '<span class="text-object">Abuse/Security</span>' who will then scan it for you.</p>
