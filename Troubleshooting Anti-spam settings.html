<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In case there are issues with the spam filters set up for your users, there are some basic troubleshooting steps that you can take. Below are some common problems that can occur and what you can do to resolve them.</p>
</div><h2>Too much spam is still showing up in the Inbox</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<ul>
<li>Set up blacklists for the entire domain instead of just the specific email sending the message. This way you’ll block all emails from that domain.</li>
<li>The anti-spam filter may not catch all of the incoming junk messages due to how the message was sent or created. DreamHost offers the option of setting up custom message filters, and you can refer to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215030678-How-do-I-enable-message-filters-on-my-email-address-">Message Filters</a> article <em>(for advanced users)</em> for further information.</li>
</ul>
</div><h2>Emails are not being sent to the Spam folder</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If the domain is not using DreamHost's nameservers, make sure you manually update your domain's DNS with the new anti-spam filtering MX records. They look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 vade-in2.mail.dreamhost.com.</li>
<li>0 vade-in1.mail.dreamhost.com.</li>
</ul>
</div><h2>Email from a whitelisted address is still sent to the Spam folder</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The email's From address may not match where the email was actually sent from. Try <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215466778-How-do-I-view-email-headers-">viewing the email headers</a> and whitelist the sending address shown there.</p>
</div><h2>I'm not able to add filters with a legacy catch-all address</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's currently not possible to set up Spam filters with a legacy catch-all address. You must delete the catch-all address first.</p>
</div><h2>I cannot disable filters after they have been enabled</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once you have enabled spam filtering on a domain, there is no way to reverse this action. They are also enabled by default on new addresses.</p>
