<h2>If you loose your Google Authenticator device</h2>
<p>If you lose your Google Authenticator device, you must use a backup code (as shown in <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215343108#backup_codes">step #5</a>) or <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/support/">write in to support</a> to regain access to your account.</p>
<h2>Resetting your password</h2>
<p>If you forget your password but still have your Google Authenticator device (or a valid backup code), you can still click on the ‘forgot password?’ link on the log in page, or click the link below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/login/forgot.cgi">https://panel.dreamhost.com/login/forgot.cgi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you click this link, a form opens that asks for your email address. Once you submit the form, DreamHost sends you a link that you can use to reset your password, as long as you still have your second authentication factor available.</p>
