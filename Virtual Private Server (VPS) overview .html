<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a premium hosting plan available as an add-on to an existing <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-" target="_self">DreamHost plan</a> or a standalone service.</p>
<p>A VPS uses Linux-Containers (LXC) to create a "virtual" server that protects a user's RAM resources from other users on the same physical machine. For example, on a shared server, resources are shared by other users. On a VPS, these resources are more isolated, which improves performance and helps to maintain stability.</p>
<p>This article gives you an overview of DreamHost's VPS hosting plan, as well as the next steps to get started.</p>

<h2><span id="What_features_does_a_VPS_include.3F">VPS features</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following is a list of features you'll have access to after adding a VPS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Protected RAM</li>
<li>Persistent processes are allowed (and are never killed)</li>
<li>Ability to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026797892-Changing-your-VPS-hosting-or-billing-plan" target="_self">upgrade RAM</a> without a restart (downgrading will restart the server)</li>
<li>Ability to reboot the server from the panel</li>
<li>Historical memory and load graphs can be viewed on the panel</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="solvvy-solution">IP addresses</h3>

</ul>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Please note that DreamHost is unable to offer static IP addresses. This means that the IPs of your site (including Unique IPs) are subject to change.</p>
<p>Although this rarely occurs, DreamHost is unable to guarantee that an IP address will never change. However, when an IP change does occur, you will be notified via email in a timely fashion.</p>
</div>
<h3><span id="Persistent_processes">Persistent processes</span></h3>
<p>Unlike a regular Shared Hosting plan, VPS hosting allows persistent processes to run. Regardless of how long it takes to run these processes (web invoked, console invoked, cron, or otherwise), the processes are never killed by the server.</p>
<h3><span id="Wildcard_DNS">Wildcard DNS</span></h3>
<p>It's possible to add Wildcard DNS to your VPS, but this must be enabled by technical support.&nbsp;Please visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217113237-Wildcard-DNS">Wildcard DNS</a> article for more information.</p>

<h2>Operating system version</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>VPS plans run the Ubuntu operating system.</p>

<h2>Are MySQL databases on the VPS?</h2>

<p>No. A VPS only runs website files. Any databases you add in your panel will default to a Shared MySQL server.</p>
<p>You can also purchase a private MySQL server, but this would be a second server in addition to your VPS. View the following article for further details:</p>
