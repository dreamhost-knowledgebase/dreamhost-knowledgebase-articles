<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost Shared, VPS, Dedicated, and DreamPress are four <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">hosting plans</a>&nbsp;available for your website.</p>
<p>The DreamHost Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a premium hosting solution based on Solid State Drives (SSDs.) It is available as an add-on to an existing DreamHost plan or a standalone service. DreamHost VPSs use Linux-VServer to create a "virtual machine" that protects a user's CPU and RAM resources from other users on the same physical machine.</p>
<p>For example, on a shared server resources are shared by other users. On a VPS, these resources are more isolated which improves performance and helps to maintain stability.</p>
<p>You can review pricing details for VPS plans on the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/">DreamHost website</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="What_features_does_a_VPS_include.3F">What features does a VPS include?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Protected CPU and RAM</li>
<li>Persistent processes are allowed (and are never killed)</li>
<li>Ability to alter the memory on the fly, without the need to reboot</li>
<li>Ability to reboot the server from the panel</li>
<li>Historical memory and load graphs can be viewed on the panel</li>
<li>SSD-based drives offering speeds 20x times faster than traditional SATA disk drives</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="solvvy-solution">IP addresses</h3>
<p>Each VPS comes with its own IP address included. You can then add a Unique IP to each domain (IPv4 or IPv6) for an additional fee. You can read more about Unique IPs here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview" target="_self">Unique IP overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that DreamHost is unable to offer static IP addresses. This means that the IP of your site (including Unique IPs) are subject to change. While it doesn't happen that often, DreamHost makes no guarantees that an IP address will never change. However when an IP change does occur, you will be notified via email in a timely fashion.</p>
<h3><span id="Persistent_processes">Persistent processes</span></h3>
<p>Unlike a regular shared hosting setup, VPSs allow for persistent processes to run. Regardless of how long it takes to run these processes (web invoked, console invoked, cron, or otherwise), the processes are never killed by the server.</p>
<h3><span id="Dynamic_server_settings_adjustment">Dynamic server settings adjustment</span></h3>
<p>Many of the key configuration options for your VPS server are configured on the fly by DreamHost's automation system to take the best advantage of your available server resources. For instance, if you have a 300MB VPS server, Apache is configured to use a smaller amount of memory than if you had a 1000MB server. The Apache configuration is proportional to the memory allocation and is adjusted when the allocation is increased for the server.</p>

<h2>How to check the version of Linux your server is running</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you need to view the version of Linux your VPS is running, log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. Once logged in, run the following command:</p>

<h2>Are MySQL databases on the VPS?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. A VPS only runs website files. Any databases you add in your panel will default to a Shared MySQL server.</p>
<p>You can also purchase a private MySQL server, but this would be a second server in addition to your VPS. View the following article for further details:</p>
