<h3>How much does a domain registration cost?</h3>
<p>The cost of each domain extension can be found on the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/domain-registration-terms/">Domain Registration Terms</a> page.</p>
<p>Some registrars only offer discounted prices if you register multiple domains at once, or register domains for several years in advance. However, DreamHost does not have any bulk requirements for domain registrations. So, even if you register just a single domain for only one year, you won’t pay any more than the listed price.</p>
<p>If you add an annual <strong>Starter Shared</strong>, <strong>Unlimited Shared/Happy Hosting</strong>, or any annual <strong>DreamPress</strong> plan to your account, you are also provided with a free credit that you can use toward qualifying TLDs for the first year of hosting. View the following article for a list of domains this applies to:</p>

<h3>When do I pay for a domain registration?</h3>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If a registration renewal price increases after you receive a renewal notice, DreamHost will honor the quoted rate in the notice. For example, if your quoted renewal is $9.99/year and the price then increases to $11.99/year, DreamHost will still bill you at $9.99/year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All purchases of a domain registration require immediate payment. Manual renewals also require immediate payment. However, DreamHost bills accounts for domains that are set to automatically renew when the automatic renewal is processed. This charge must be paid in full within 60-days from the date of the charge.</p>
<span id="howpay_reg"></span>
<h3>How can I pay for a domain registration?</h3>
<p>New domain registrations can only be processed via a major credit card or through the use of a credit balance on the account. That said, you can prepay to your account using Paypal or a check sent in advanced so that the account is left with a credit balance.</p>
<h2><span id="Can_domain_registrations_be_refunded">Can domain registrations be refunded?</span></h2>
<p>Registrations are generally non-refundable. However, some TLDs can possibly be refunded within 5 days of the registration date. Please submit a support ticket to inquire if the domain registration is available for a refund.</p>
<h2><span id="WIll_I_be_alerted_when_payment_is_due">WIll I be alerted when payment is due?</span></h2>
<p>Yes. DreamHost sends notifications to the email address you registered when creating your account. Only the primary account email address will receive the notices so if you have created privileged users on your DreamHost account, they will not receive any notices even if they have access to billing.</p>
<h2><span id="Can_I_sell_my_domain_name">Can I sell my domain name?</span></h2>
<p>You own the rights to your domain, so you can sell it to anyone you like. Once you have a buyer who is willing to purchase your domain, transferring ownership is as simple as transferring the registration to the buyer's registrar. View the following article for instructions on how to transfer your domain name:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="bulk_discounts">Are there any bulk discounts if I purchase multiple domains?</span></h2>
<p>There are currently no bulk-discount options. All domains must be purchased at their specific rate. You can view a full pricing list here:</p>
