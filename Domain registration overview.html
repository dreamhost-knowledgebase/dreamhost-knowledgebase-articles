<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A domain registration is the name of your site, which must first be purchased in order for the domain to display online. There are a variety of different names and Top Level Domains (TLDs) that you can choose from in order to register. This article provides general information in regards to domain registrations with DreamHost.</p>
</div>
<span id="basics"></span>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Generally speaking, there are two major steps to get your site online:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase the domain registration (the name of your site).</li>
<li>Purchase a hosting plan and add your site to it.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A domain registration (or TLD - Top Level Domain) is the first half of a two-step process for getting a site on the Internet. Purchasing a domain registration provides contact information for the registrant (the owner of the domain name), and assigns the nameservers which control the domains DNS settings.</p>
<p>The registration information for any domain name can be looked up with a WHOIS search. You can take a look at the following article for more details on the WHOIS information and how you can retrieve it for your domain name:</p>

<p>The common .COM/.NET/.ORG/ and .INFO (as well as other TLDs) offer privacy for the contact information you provide when you register. However other TLDs may not offer any privacy protection. View the following article for a list of registrations that do NOT support privacy at DreamHost:</p>

<h2>Hosting your domain registration</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your domain registration was purchased at DreamHost, you can host it by adding a hosting plan and adding your site to it.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If instead you had previously purchased the registration at another company, you must update your DNS settings at that company. View the following article for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004289812-How-to-host-your-domain-at-DreamHost-if-it-is-registered-at-another-company">How to host your domain at DreamHost if it is registered at another company</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<span id="changing-name"></span>
<h2>Changing the spelling of a new registration</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every domain purchased is unique on the Internet. Even if there is a single letter different in the spelling of a domain, it's still considered a completely different domain name.</p>
<p>This means that if you misspelled a domain when you purchased it, there is no way to adjust its spelling. The only option would be to purchase a new domain with a different spelling.</p>
<h3>Refunding a misspelled domain</h3>
<p>Domain registrations end in different TLDs such as .com, .net, .io, .life. Each of these has different rules as to when or if you can cancel the registration after it's purchased. Contact support immediately if you need to cancel a new registration.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Please note that it's not possible to cancel many types of TLDs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the few that do allow the registration to be canceled have a very short time frame as to when this can be done, usually no more than a few days. Make sure to contact support immediately if you need to cancel the registration.</p>
