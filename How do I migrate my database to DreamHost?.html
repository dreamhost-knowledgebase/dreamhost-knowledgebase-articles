<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When moving your hosting to DreamHost, it may be necessary to migrate your website’s database. This article describes how to transfer a MySQL database to your DreamHost account.</p>
</div>
<h2>Creating a MySQL database in your panel</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before you can import a database, it must first be created in your panel. As a security precaution, a DreamHost database can only be created within the panel on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.mysql" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL Databases</a> page. It is not possible to create the database during import.</p>
<p>View the following article for details on how to create your database:</p>

<h2>Importing your database</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Importing with phpMyAdmin</h3>
<p>If your SQL backup file is under 64 MB in size, it can be imported into your new database via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>. View the following article to import a backed up database through phpMyAdmin:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Importing using SSH</h3>
<p>If it's 64 MB or more, (or if you encounter a timeout while importing) the only other option is to import it from the command line via SSH.</p>

<h2>Pointing your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you have everything set up at DreamHost, it's time to update your DNS at your current host. You can either point your nameservers to DreamHost which points ALL of your DNS records, or you can just point specific A records. View the following articles for further details:</p>
