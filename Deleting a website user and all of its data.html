<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A website 'user' is also referred to as the username assigned to a domain. This is the username you use to log into the server via FTP or SSH and in order to update your site.&nbsp;Every website has a user assigned to it, and you can change the user at any time.</p>
<p>If you have changed the user of your site, or have deleted your website in the panel, you can also delete the user from the server to ensure that all of the user's data along with any former website data is also deleted.</p>
</div>
<h2>Before you delete a user</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's highly recommending that you first back up all user data and then make sure there are no websites assigned to a user that you wish to delete.</p>
<h3>Backing up all data</h3>
<p>To back up any data under the user, log into your server via FTP:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you log in, download to your home computer any files and folders you wish to save.</p>
<h3>Making sure no websites are assigned to the user</h3>
<p>No websites can be assigned to a user that you wish to delete. You can confirm this on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> page. The username is displayed to the right of the domain under the 'Web Hosting' column:</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/website-username.png" alt="website username" /></p>
<p>You should not see the username you're about to delete anywhere on this page. If you do, you must first change the user that is assigned to any remaining domains. See the following article for more details on how to make a change these changes to a user:</p>

<h2>Deleting a user</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you back up all of the website data and ensure no domain names are assigned to the user, you can now proceed with deleting the user from the server.</p>
