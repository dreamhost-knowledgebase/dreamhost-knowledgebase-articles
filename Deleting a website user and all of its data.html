<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A website 'user' is also referred to as the username assigned to a domain. This is the username you use to log into the server via FTP or SSH in order to update your site. Every website has a user assigned to it, and you can change the user at any time.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>View the following article for instructions on locating a website's username:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#username" target="_self">Locating your FTP login credentials</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you have changed the user of your website or have deleted your website in the panel, you can also delete the user from the server to ensure that all of the user's data, along with any former website data, is also deleted.</p>
</div>
<h2>Before you delete a user</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's highly recommended that you first back up all user data and then make sure there are no websites assigned to a user that you wish to delete.</p>
<h3>Back up all data</h3>
<p>To back up any data under the user, log into your server via FTP:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you log in, download any files and folders you wish to save to your home computer.</p>
<h3>Reassign websites to a different user</h3>
<p>If a website was previously assigned to the username you wish to delete, it must be reassigned to a new username. You can view the domains assigned to a user on the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SFTP Users &amp; Files</a> page. Under the <span class="text-object">Username / Domain name</span> column, you'll see the username with any domains currently assigned to it.</p>

<h2>Deleting a user</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you back up all of the website data and ensure no domain names are assigned to the user, you can now proceed with deleting the user from the server.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The following steps permanently remove the user's data from the server. It is not possible to retrieve any of this data after you delete it from the panel. Please be sure you've backed up all the user's data before proceeding further.</p>
