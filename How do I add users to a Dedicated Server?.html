<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The normal Shell user cannot run sudo/root commands on the server. If you need to run sudo/root commands, you must create an admin user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add an admin user:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=dedicated.usersdashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admin Users</a> page in your panel.

<li><strong>Select the Shell Type</strong> — Select a Shell type that you wish to you use. You can select bash, tcsh, ksh, or zsh from the drop-down list. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216557548-Available-shells-at-DreamHost" target="_self">Shell types</a> article for more information.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>I have read and agreed to the terms of use</strong> — Check the check box. You must check the 'terms of use' check box in order to add a new admin user.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Important note about custom Admin user changes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>With an admin user, you can make root/sudo changes to your server, but please note that your Dedicated Server is still managed by DreamHost. This means that if you make any custom changes to Apache, they will be overwritten whenever an Apache config is run. This can happen when adding hosting to a domain, or adding an SSL certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you make any custom changes, make sure to clearly note what they were so you can quickly fix anything that was overwritten.</p>
