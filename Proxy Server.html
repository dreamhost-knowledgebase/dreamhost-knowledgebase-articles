<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On&nbsp;a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-VPS-overview-">DreamHost Virtual Private Server</a> (VPS) or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated server</a>, you may configure a Proxy Server. You can configure it on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.proxy&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxy</a> page in&nbsp;the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost panel</a>.</p>

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The Proxy Server feature is a reverse proxy using Apache <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html"><span class="code">mod_proxy</span></a>.</p>
<p><span class="code">mod_proxy</span> forwards requests that Apache receives on to another running process through a specific port. You can only forward requests to daemons bound to all hosts, and only on ports above 8000.</p>
</div>
<h2>Daemon processes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A daemon process is a server process that listens for communication from remote <em>clients</em>. For example, the Apache Web server is a daemon that listens for TCP socket connections from Web browser client applications. Some servers, such as TeamSpeak or game servers, might also listen for UDP packets.</p>
<p>A DreamHost VPS (or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated Server)</a> account permits you to run daemon server processes. They are limited to the server resources (CPU/RAM) you pay for. This differs from a shared hosting plan, where these processes could adversely affect other users on the same server.</p>
<p>Daemon processes that bind to a port (on which they listen for incoming connections) are visible from the Internet. DreamHost does not employ any sort of firewall or port blocking on its network.</p>
