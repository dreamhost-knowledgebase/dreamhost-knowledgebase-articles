<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you have viewed your 'Mirror' site to confirm your WordPress installation appears as it should, you are now ready to update your DNS.</p>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<h3>Option #1 — Pointing your nameservers</h3>
<p>This options points all of your DNS records to DreamHost including email. Only use this option if you want all of your website's services hosted at DreamHost.</p>
<p>Return to your old host and set the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-How-do-I-change-my-nameservers-at-my-current-host-">nameservers</a> for your domain registration to point to DreamHost using these nameservers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong>&nbsp;<span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">162.159.26.24</span></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong>&nbsp;<span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">162.159.27.142</span></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">162.159.27.84</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>When updating your nameservers at your registrar, you should only have to add the nameserver URL, not the IP. The IPs are listed above just in case your registrar asks for them.</p>

<p>This modification takes about 3–72 hours to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> across the Internet, after which your new nameservers will direct visitors to your account with DreamHost.</p>

</ul>

</div>
<h3>Option #2 — Pointing your A records</h3>
<p>This option allows you to only point your site's A records (IP addresses) to DreamHost. Use this option if you are hosting email at another company and only want your website hosted at DreamHost. View the following article for instructions on how to find your site's IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DreamHost DNS overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the DNS is resolving to DreamHost, visiting your site displays the site as it appears on your DreamHost server.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Checking_for_a_successful_installation">Checking for a successful installation</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you've done everything correctly, your domain will now resolve to your WordPress installation on your DreamHost account. If you need to check if the domain is pointing to the right server, upload a text file to your domain's root directory on your DreamHost server. For example, upload a file named <span class="text-object">test.txt</span>. Then, try to access that file via a web browser at <span class="text-object">example.com/test.txt</span>. If it's there, that means your domain is now pointing to the correct place.</p>
<p>Make sure that you don't make any edits on your WordPress installation during the 48-hour waiting period, since any changes that you make or any new content that you add will not carry over to your DreamHost account unless you re-transfer the database as described in the following article.</p>
