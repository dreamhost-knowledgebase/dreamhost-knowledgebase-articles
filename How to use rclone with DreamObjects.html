<p><a class="reference external" href="https://rclone.org">Rclone</a> is an rsync-like tool for Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and other operating systems designed for cloud storage such as DreamObjects.</p>
<p>It features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>MD5/SHA1 hashes checked at all times for file integrity</li>
<li>Timestamps preserved on files</li>
<li>Partial syncs supported on a whole file basis</li>
<li>Copy mode to just copy new/changed files</li>
<li>Sync (one way) mode to make a directory identical</li>
<li>Check mode to check for file hash equality</li>
<li>Can sync to and from network, e.g., two different cloud accounts</li>
<li>Optional encryption (Crypt)</li>
<li>Optional FUSE mount (rclone mount)</li>

<h2>Configure rclone</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and install rclone based on your computer's operating system. You can download it from rclone's site here:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/downloads/">rclone.org Downloads</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once downloaded, navigate to the directory the file was downloaded to. (NOTE: In Windows you can navigate to the /Downloads directory and extract the rclone files. You then need to open your command prompt and navigate to the directory the files were extracted to.</li>
<li>In your terminal or command prompt, run the following to begin configuring rclone using the interactive configuration tool.
<div class="preboxcontainer">

<p>Make a new bucket:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[user@localhost]$ </span><span class="command">rclone mkdir dreamobjects:mynewbucket</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess files in the bucket:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[user@localhost]$ </span><span class="command">rclone sync /home/local/directory dreamobjects:mynewbucket</span></pre>
