<p>Cloud-init is the package that handles early initialization of a cloud
instance: it can be used to automatically configure a new server as
soon as it starts, without logging into it. This tutorial shows how
install fail2ban in any Linux distribution available on DreamHost
Cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud-init can be used either the web dashboard, or using the command
line.</p>
<div id="using-the-web-dashboard">
<h2>Using the Web Dashboard</h2>
<p>Open the web dashboard in a browser, then navigate to the instance tab
by clicking on Compute &gt; Instances on the left side of the browser.
Click the <a class="reference external" href="https://iad2.dreamcompute.com/project/instances/launch">Launch Instance button</a>, give your
instance a name, boot from a Linux-based image (Ubuntu, Debian, , select the default
security group, then click the “Post Creation” Button on the far right
of the “Launch Instance” page. Here you can either upload a file to be
used with Cloud-Init or just input the contents of the file into the
web UI. Copy and paste the text below into the text box.</p>

<div id="using-the-openstack-client">
<h2>Using the OpenStack Client</h2>
<p>You can create an DreamCompute instance and pass it a script for cloud init to
execute at creation using the openstack commandline client. First you need a file to
with the script that you want to run, we’ll call it cloud-init.sh. We want
Cloud-Init to install fail2ban, so the contents of cloud-init.sh should be:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
packages:
 - fail2ban
# download a custom config file hosted on a public server
runcmd:
 - [ wget, "http://dhurl.org/2gy", -O, /etc/fail2ban/jail.local ]
 - service fail2ban restart
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The command to create an instance that runs cloud-init.sh at creation is:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[user@localhost]$ openstack server create --image Ubuntu-16.04 --flavor \
    gp1.semisonic --security-group default --key-name stef --user-data \
    cloud-init.sh newserver
</pre></div>

on how to launch an instance from the command line</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-your-own-script-to-be-used-with-cloud-init">
<h2>Writing your own script to be used with Cloud-Init</h2>
<p>You can put anything in a shell script for Cloud-Init to execute while creating
your instance, although you should only run commands that don’t take user
input. Cloud-Init can be used to install packages at instance creation, but if
you want to install more than a couple things that you need to manage closely,
it is recommended you use a configuration management tool like Ansible or
Puppet as they provide more control over your system.</p>
