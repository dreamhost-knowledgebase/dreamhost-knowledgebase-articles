<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Private networking is a useful feature that you may wish to utilize for advanced cloud setups. For a description of private networking and how to have it enabled on your account, please review the following article:</p>

<h2>Private network options</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once DreamHost technical support has enabled private networking, you can add a private network to your account. Please review the options below to determine settings for the private network.</p>
<div id="network-block">
<h3>Network block</h3>
<p>There are various private network blocks that are available for use with private networks which are specified in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> format. Common examples of this are 10.0.0.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24, however there are <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_address_spaces">other networks</a> to choose from as well. In the example below, the address 10.0.0.0/24 is used.</p>
</div>
<div id="dhcp">
<h3>DHCP</h3>
<p>When a subnet is defined, DHCP can be set to enabled or disabled. It can also be changed later if desired. When DHCP is enabled, newly created instances run cloud-init at startup and detect it, therefore determining it isn't necessary to hard-code network settings into the operating system.</p>
<p>If it is disabled, these settings are hard-coded. Having DHCP enabled can help with creating snapshots and new instances from those snapshots as the snapshots won't have hard-coded network configs in them.</p>

<h2>Checking if Private Networking has been enabled</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you have requested that Private Networking be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/229789688-Private-networking-overview">enabled on your account</a>, check your DreamCompute dashboard to confirm it's enabled.</p>

</dl>
<p>In the left pane, click the <span class="text-object">Project &gt; Network &gt; Networks</span> tabs. To the right you'll see a <strong>Create Network</strong> button. If the button is greyed out and says 'Quota exceeded', private networking has not been enabled on your project yet. Once it has been enabled, you'll be able to press this button to add a private network.</p>
