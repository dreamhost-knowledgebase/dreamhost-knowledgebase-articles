<p>Once you set up a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Enabling-Shell-access">shell user</a> and try to log in via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>, you'll find you must enter your password each time. If you’d like to avoid entering your password every time, you can set up Passwordless Login. This way, you'll be able to automatically login each time immediately without needing to enter your password.</p>

<p>If you click 'Enter', the key will be created with the default name of 'id_rsa'. You can name this anything you like, but if you choose a custom name, you'll need to let your SSH client know about the new key name. View Step #3 below for details.</p>
<p>Also, if you choose to use a custom name, make sure to specify the full path to your user's .ssh directory. If you do not, the new key pair is created in the directory you're running the command.</p>

<p>In that folder is your <strong>authorized_keys</strong> file which was just copied from your home computer which has 600 permissions.</p>
<h2>STEP 3 – Adding your custom key to your ssh client.</h2>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>This step is only necessary if you gave your key a custom name in Step #1 above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When creating your key pair, you choose what to name it. For example, the default name is 'id_rsa', but you can name it anything you like while creating it. However, if you choose a custom name, you'll need to let your SSH client know about the new key.</p>
<p>You do this by starting ssh-agent. Start ssh-agent by running the following command. Make sure you use the <strong>backquote ` character</strong> and not a single quote – this backquote character is usually on the top left of your keyboard on the tilde ~ key:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">eval `ssh-agent`</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can then run the following command (make sure to change customkey_rsa to your keyname):</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">ssh-add ~/.ssh/customkey_rsa</span></pre>
</div>
<p>You can then check to confirm it's been added by running the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">ssh-add -l</span>
2048 aa:42:d4:46:81:43:65:7f:4e:53:94:5f:2f:0d:fd:bd customkey_rsa (RSA)</pre>
</div>
<p>It will respond with your private key's fingerprint. You can confirm that fingerprint by generating a fingerprint from your custom key's public file.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">ssh-keygen -l -f customkey_rsa.pub</span>
2048 aa:42:d4:46:81:43:65:7f:4e:53:94:5f:2f:0d:fd:bd user@server (RSA)</pre>
</div>
<h2><span id="STEP_FOUR_.E2.80.93_Confirming_the_SSH_connection">STEP 4 – Confirming the SSH connection</span></h2>
<p>If everything is configured properly, you should now be able to access your DreamHost account through SSH without a password. Run this command on your home computer where you just created the original keypair.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ssh username@server.dreamhost.com</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>You should now be able to log in without using a password.</p>
<h2>Specifying a key pair for SSH to use</h2>
<p>By default, your client will use the identity (private key) named ~/.ssh/id_rsa. However, if you've created more than one key, you can specify which one to use when connecting using the <span class="code">-i</span> flag. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ssh -i ~/.ssh/customkey username@server.dreamhost.com</span>
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Confirm the identity being used</h3>
<p>You can confirm the identity (private key) you're using if you add the <span class="code">-v</span> flag.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ssh -v username@server.dreamhost.com</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This will display a lot of output, but you're looking for these lines to confirm which identity you're using.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">debug1: identity file /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa type 1
debug1: identity file /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1<br />debug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, the id_rsa key is being used.</p>
<h3>What if you have more than one key pair?</h3>
<p>If you have more than one key, you'll need to add them all to ssh-agent. For example, if you have an id_rsa key in addition to a custom key, make sure you add both using <span class="code">ssh-add</span> (as shown above). This will ensure that the 'Offering RSA public key' line above displays the correct key when connecting.</p>
