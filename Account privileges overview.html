<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Account Privileges allow you to grant account access to another person so they can edit settings within the panel. When you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694248-How-do-I-add-or-remove-account-privileges-">create account privileges</a>, you are able to choose how much access is allowed.</p>

<p>For example, if you have four websites in your account and you want someone else to have access to only one of them, you can choose which domain, emails, and databases you want to provide access.</p>

<p>You won't have the ability to assign account privileges to another user for <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000760131-Getting-started-with-Remixer" target="_self">Remixer</a> projects. Only the primary account holder is able to create, edit, and publish Remixer projects.</p>

<h2>How does the new user log in?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your new panel user can log in at <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">panel.dreamhost.com</a> just as you do. The only difference is what they have access to within your panel.</p>
</div>
<h2>What the granted user sees in the panel</h2>

<p>It's important to keep your account in good standing if you are granting other users access to your account. An account that has fallen past due will result in extremely limited panel usage that can only be lifted after the overdue balance is paid.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When the newly created user logs into their account, they only see the information you have allowed.</p>
<p>In the following example, the user does not have access to any billing privileges. This is why those options show as grayed out when the <span class="text-section">Billing &amp; Account</span> section is viewed:</p>
