<p>Account Privileges allow you to grant account access to another person so they can edit settings within the panel. When you create account privileges, you are able to choose how much access is allowed.</p>
<p>For example, if you have four websites in your account and you want someone else to have access to only one of them, you can choose which domain, emails, and databases you want to provide access.</p>
<h2><strong>What the granted user sees in the panel</strong></h2>
<p>When the newly created user logs into their account, they only see the information you have allowed.</p>
<p>In the following example, the user does not have access to any billing privileges. This is why those options show as grayed out when the 'Billing &amp; Account' section is viewed:</p>

</dl>
<p>Since billing privileges have not been added, this new user cannot add or renew registrations either. Below is what a user sees in the panel when they click the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">‘Domains &gt; Registrations’</a> link:</p>
