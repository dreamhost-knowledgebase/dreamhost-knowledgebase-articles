<p>Your DreamHost panel offers a domain restore option to restore your domain. This only restores files on your web server, not your database server. Some websites do not use a database so this article is all you need to restore your site.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>As stated on the Restore page (described below), DreamHost does not guarantee the backups for your domains. It is highly recommended that you always keep local backups of your site contents just in case a DreamHost backup is not available.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The files are restored from the web server your site is currently hosted on. The restore service does not restore data from any other web server you may have previously migrated from.</p>

<p>To restore your website:</p>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Choose from the following sections:
<ul>
<li><strong>Available Backup Dates:</strong> There are three time-frame options available for your domain’s backups:</li>
<ul>
<li>1 hour to 1 day</li>
<li>1 day to 2 weeks</li>
<li>2 weeks or possibly more</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Restore Options:</strong> The two options allow you to either restore the selected backups to your current live site or restore the selected backups as a separate folder.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Copy the backup files to: /home/username/example.com_TIMESTAMP</pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>The first option keeps the current site live. Your backup files are retrieved and stored in a new directory. This directory is named after your site, followed by a timestamp. Use this option if you want to view your backed up files before changing your site to the old version.</em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Make the backup copy live and back up all the current live files to
/home/username/example.com_TIMESTAMP
</pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>The second option takes the existing backup and immediately makes it your live website. The files currently on the site are then moved to a directory named after your site, followed by a timestamp. Use this option if you want your site to immediately revert to the old version.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the blue <strong>Restore example.com now!</strong> button to complete this process. (Replace the domain name listed in the button with your own domain name being restored.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you click the <strong>Restore</strong> button, you are redirected back to the ‘Manage Domains’ page where you see a green message at the top of the page stating that the restore is processing and will complete based on how large the backups are. You are notified via email once that completes.</p>
