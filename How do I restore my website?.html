<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your DreamHost panel offers a domain restore option to restore your domain. This only restores files on your web server, not your database server. Some websites do not use a database and only need this article to restore the site.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The instructions in this article do not apply to Dedicated Servers. If your sites are hosted on a Dedicated Server, you must manually restore backups using an admin user. See the following article for more information on this process:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>When you restore a website, the files are restored from your site's web server. The restore service does not restore data from any other web server you may have previously migrated from.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If your site is running WordPress or any other software that uses a database, view the following article for instructions on how to also restore your database:</p>

<p>As stated on the Restore page (described below), DreamHost does not guarantee domain backups. It is highly recommended that you keep local backups of your site contents in case a DreamHost backup is unavailable.</p>
<p>DreamHost cannot guarantee that any data will be retained on inactive (suspended/closed/disabled) accounts for longer than two weeks following the account's status change. See the following knowledge base articles for more information on how you can back up your account or make a payment:</p>
