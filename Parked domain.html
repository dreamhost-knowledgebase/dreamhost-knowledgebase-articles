<p>When adding a domain to your panel, you can configure it in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting">Fully Hosted</a>&nbsp;— This means it appears on the Internet</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-Redirect-a-domain">Redirect</a>&nbsp;— This redirects your domain to a Fully Hosted website</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416417-Mirror-domain-overview">Mirrored</a>&nbsp;— This mirrors a Fully Hosted website</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056398191-Setting-your-domain-to-DNS-Only-" target="_self" rel="undefined">DNS Only</a>&nbsp;— This removes hosting and allows you to point your DNS outside of DreamHost</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a final option called 'Parked'. A Parked domain doesn't do anything and has no settings. All of the options above either display a site or point to a site to display. A Parked domain is just a placeholder until you decide to do something with the website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parked domains are not hosted, so there is no server to log into to upload data.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HDQMQDTF2KKHVEAEBCESW38H">How to unpark a domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To unpark a domain, you must assign it a different hosting type. The following are all options you can change to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting">Fully Hosted</a>&nbsp;— This means it appears on the Internet</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-Redirect-a-domain">Redirect</a>&nbsp;— This redirects your domain to a Fully Hosted website</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416417-Mirror-domain-overview">Mirrored</a>&nbsp;— This mirrors a Fully Hosted website</li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056398191-Setting-your-domain-to-DNS-Only-" target="_self" rel="undefined">DNS Only</a>&nbsp;— This removes hosting and allows you to point your DNS outside of DreamHost</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>To Fully Host a domain again that you formerly Parked, you must complete the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020605511-Moving-a-domain-to-a-new-user">Assign the domain to the same username it was previously configured with.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041534491-Changing-the-web-directory-assigned-to-a-domain">Make sure the 'Web directory' (where the website files are located) is the same as it was when you Parked it.</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>After changing the hosting type, the new DNS values must propagate online which could take up to 6 hours. View the following article for further details:</p>
