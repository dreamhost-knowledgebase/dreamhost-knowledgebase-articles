<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following is a brief overview of Sectigo (formerly Comodo), and how it affects your certificate.</p>
</div><h2>What is Sectigo?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Sectigo is simply the new name of Comodo.</p>
<p>On November 1, 2018, Comodo announced that the company is rebranding to Sectigo. For more information about this, please see the following announcement at Sectigo's website:</p>

</ul>
</div><h2>How does this affect my certificate?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The new name does not affect your certificate at all.</p>
<p>However, any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 will reference Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificates issued prior to that will still reference Comodo. These are still the same company, and the only difference is the name.</p>
