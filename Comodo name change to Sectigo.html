<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following is a brief overview of Sectigo (formerly Comodo), and how it affects your certificate.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is Sectigo?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Sectigo is simply the new name of Comodo.</p>
<p>On November 1, 2018, Comodo announced that the company is rebranding to Sectigo. For more information about this, please see the following announcement at Sectigo's website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sectigo.com/comodo" target="_self" rel="undefined">Comodo CA Is Now Sectigo</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>How does this affect my certificate?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The new name does not affect your certificate at all.</p>
<p>However, any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 references Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificates issued prior to that reference Comodo. Both names&nbsp;<a href="https://sectigo.com/comodo" target="_self">refer to the same company</a>.</p>
