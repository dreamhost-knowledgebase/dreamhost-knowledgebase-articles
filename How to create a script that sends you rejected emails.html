<p>The following describes how to create a script and cron job that sends you rejected emails from the server.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>When an email is sent from your web server and it then gets blocked or rejected, it is stored in the following directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/username/Maildir/new</pre>
</div>
<p>To view the blocked or rejected emails, you must manually log into your server and check this directory. A simpler option is to instead create a cron job that triggers a shell script. The script then tells the server to email you any blocked or rejected emails when it occurs.</p>
<p>For more information about blocked or rejected emails, see the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215036118-Sender-domain-policy-FAQs">Sender domain policy FAQs</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating the shell script</h2>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure you're in your user's home directory:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">pwd</span>
/home/username</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Create <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">a new file via SSH</a>, and then name it something like <span class="code">mailrejections.sh</span>.</li>
<li>Add the following code to this file:
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<ul>
<li>You only need to change the fields in bold.</li>
<li>You can change the message to anything you like.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">#!/bin/bash

#Check ~/Maildir/new for any files created within the last 15 min
files=$(find ~/Maildir/new -type f -mmin -15)

for emailFileName in $files; do
  #open each email individually and assign to new variable
  emailContent=$(cat $emailFileName)<br/>  printf '%s\n' "${emailContent[*]}" | mail -s "<span class="command">These emails were rejected" admin@example.com</span>
done</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Make sure to change the email to the address you'd like to receive these notifications from.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creating the cron job</h2>
<p>After you create the script, you must create a new cron job to run every 15 minutes. The cron job then runs the file you just created.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new cron job <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215088668-How-do-I-create-a-cron-job-">in your panel</a>:
<dl>
<dd><img alt="" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/mailrejection_cronjob.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Make sure to adjust the username to the correct Shell user for which you created the script.</li>
<li>Select 'Every 15 minutes' for the time frame.
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You can change the time frame to anything you like, but just make sure to update the same time frame in your script to match.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cron job runs your script every 15 minutes. If an email is rejected, a copy of it is then sent to the address you specified in the script.</p>
