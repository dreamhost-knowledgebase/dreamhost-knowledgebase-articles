<p>Your database credentials allow you to log into your database in the panel using phpMyAdmin. <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a> is a graphical interface where you can navigate through your database and make changes.</p>
<p>These same credentials can also be used to connect to the database using any software you like.</p>
<h2>Step #1: Find your database name</h2>
<p>Visit the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'MySQL Databases'</a>) page and scroll down to the section titled 'Databases on this server'. Below you'll see a listing of your databases.</p>
<p>If you installed a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089938-What-One-Click-Installs-does-DreamHost-offer-">One-Click Install</a> from the panel, you'll see its name under the description column. If you have multiple databases, you'll need to identify the one that corresponds to your website. Make a note of the database name.</p>

<h2>Step #2: Find your username</h2>
<p>The specific username tied to the database is listed to the right of your databases. Make a note of this.<img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/database_credentials_02.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Step #3: Find your password</h2>
<p>Click the username.</p>
<p><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/database_credentials_03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the next page, click the <strong>Show</strong> button to view the user's password. Make a note of this.</p>
<h2>Step #4: Find your hostname</h2>
<p>Navigate back to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'MySQL Databases'</a>) page.</p>
<p><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/database_credentials_04.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Near the top you'll see a section titled 'Hostnames for this MySQL server'. Look for the hostname that corresponds to your website. It most likely has the website's name in it.</p>
<p>To the right of the hostname is a link titled phpMyAdmin. Click this link to open the phpMyAdmin login page.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>You can also use the official phpMyAdmin hostname of your data center. First check the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.dc&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Data Center's)</a> page. Scroll down to locate the data center your MySQL services are located in. It's either West coast or East coast. You can then use the following hostnames to connect depending on the location of your MySQL server.</p>
<br><strong>West Coast:</strong> <a href="https://west1-phpmyadmin.dreamhost.com">https://west1-phpmyadmin.dreamhost.com</a><br> <strong>East Coast:</strong> <a href="https://east1-phpmyadmin.dreamhost.com">https://east1-phpmyadmin.dreamhost.com</a>

<p>phpMyAdmin requires that the domain for your MySQL hostname is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Fully Hosted</a> and uses <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DreamHost's DNS</a>. You can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a> to DreamHost, or</li>
<li>Point your A record to your DreamHost IP. View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS article</a> for details on how to retrieve that IP address.</li>
