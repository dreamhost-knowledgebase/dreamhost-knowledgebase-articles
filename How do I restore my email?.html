<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost maintains a set of backups for DreamHost-hosted email accounts, and these can be manually restored upon request.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>DreamHost does not guarantee the backups for your emails. It is highly recommended that you always keep local backups of your email addresses just in case a DreamHost backup is not available.</p>
