<h2>Changing your WordPress domain name</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<div class="solvvy-solution">

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Troubleshooting: PHP files downloading after a migration</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In some circumstances, a site migrated to DreamHost from another hosting provider will not load correctly. When accessing the site, the browser will download a PHP file rather than display the webpage. This is typically caused by leftover code from the old hosting provider, most commonly the presence of an <span class="code">AddHandler</span> entry in the site's <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file like the example below:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="code-highlight">AddHandler</span> application/x-httpd-php70 .php</pre>
</div>
<p>This code is not needed on DreamHost's servers and should be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP" target="_self">removed from the WordPress .htaccess file</a> after the site is migrated over.</p>
