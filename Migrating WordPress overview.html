<p>If you are having trouble migrating your website from another host, or just don't have the time, DreamHost currently offers a service that takes care of that for you. You can find more information in the DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027686731-Website-migration-services">Website migration services</a> article.</p>

<p>Migrating a WordPress site is different from migrating a simple HTML website because WordPress sites depend on both web files as well as a MySQL database to run. This overview explains&nbsp;your options depending on the type of migration you need.</p>

<h2>Migrating a WordPress site from a different host</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are migrating a WordPress site from a different hosting company (host), there are many different options available to you. Here are some of the more popular methods from which you can choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrating your site using&nbsp;the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360035448951-Using-the-DreamHost-Automated-Migration-WordPress-plugin" target="_self">DreamHost Automated Migration WordPress plugin</a></li>
<li>Requesting DreamHost Professional Services to migrate your site for a fee (as explained in the notebox at the top of this page)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Keeping the same domain name</h3>
<p>If you are keeping the same domain name and you want to minimize downtime on the current site while you are migrating, you might benefit from setting up a mirror of your DreamHost site using a temporary <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284771-What-is-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-">.dreamhosters.com subdomain</a>:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Changing the domain name</h3>
<p>If you are migrating your WordPress site to DreamHost using the DreamHost Automated Migration Plugin, or with the help of DreamHost Professional Services, there is no need to manually update WordPress with the new domain name after the move completes. The DreamHost Automated Migration Plugin changes the domain name for you during the migration process, and any migrations done by the DreamHost Professional Services team include changing the domain name if needed.</p>
<p>If you choose not to use one of these options and migrate manually using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>, you must&nbsp;manually update your migrated site to the new domain name. After you complete the five steps in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693178-How-to-manually-migrate-WordPress-to-DreamHost">Migrating Manually instructions</a>, the following guide’s steps 5 through 7 help you rename your WordPress site manually:</p>

<h2>Moving a WordPress site between domains on your DreamHost account</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you wish to keep a WordPress site’s content but change its domain name to a new one, the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049679412-Changing-the-domain-of-a-WordPress-site">domain name change tool</a> in the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Websites</a> page can be used to move the content and change the domain name automatically.</p>
<p>If instead, you wish to manually move between domains, the following guide explains other methods to make sure your content fully changes to the new domain name:</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting: PHP files downloading after a migration</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In some circumstances, a site migrated to DreamHost from another hosting provider will not load correctly. When accessing the site, the browser will download a PHP file rather than display the webpage. This is typically caused by leftover code from the old hosting provider, most commonly the presence of an <span class="code">AddHandler</span> entry in the site's <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file like the example below:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="code-highlight">AddHandler</span> application/x-httpd-php70 .php</pre>
</div>
<p>This code is not needed on DreamHost's servers and should be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP" target="_self">removed from the WordPress .htaccess file</a> after the site is migrated over.</p>
