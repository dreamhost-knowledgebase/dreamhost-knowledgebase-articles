<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>PuTTY is a free terminal emulator which supports various network protocols such as <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216606088-Telnet">Telnet</a>, rlogin, and SCP. It was originally available only for Windows, but is now also available on various UNIX platforms, with work-in-progress ports to Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X. At DreamHost, you are able to use PuTTY to log into your web server through your SHELL username.</p>

<h2><span id="Downloading_PuTTY">Downloading PuTTY</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Use the following steps to download and set up PuTTY onto your Windows computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>On your Windows computer:
<ul>
<li>navigate to <span class="text-object">C:\</span></li>
<li>In that directory, create a folder named <span class="text-object">\bin</span></li>
</ul>
This is the location into which you’ll download your PuTTY files. It doesn’t necessarily matter where you download them, but adding this directory makes it easier to keep track of the files.</li>
<li>Open the download page in your browser:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html" target="_self" rel="undefined">chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Download the PuTTY files from that site into your C:\bin folder:
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>There are 2 options when downloading.</p>
<h3>Option 1</h3>
<p>The package file at the top of the page ending in <span class="text-object">.msi</span>. This downloads all files you'll need. It downloads all files into <span class="text-object">C:/Program Files/PuTTY</span>.</p>
<h3>Option 2</h3>
<p>Download individual files. If you do this, note that there are 3 different choices for each file. You most likely want the <span class="text-object">64-bit x86</span> option.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">putty.exe</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">puttygen.exe</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">pagent.exe</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory the files were downloaded to and double click the <span class="text-object">putty.exe</span> file to open. Or, you could create a shortcut on your Desktop for easy access:
<ul>
<li>Right click on your Desktop and choose ‘New &gt; Shortcut’</li>
<li>Browse to the location of your <span class="text-object">putty.exe</span> file (it should be C:\Users\bin\putty.exe)</li>
<li>Save the shortcut</li>
</ul>
