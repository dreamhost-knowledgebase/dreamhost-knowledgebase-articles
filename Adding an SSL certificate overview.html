<h2>Types of SSL certificates</h2>
<div class="solvvy-hidden">
<p>There are two types of SSL certificates you can add to your domain within the DreamHost panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#lets_encrypt">Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#comodo">Sectigo verified SSL ($15/year)</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Please note that <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537#Wildcard_certificates">wildcard certificates</a> are currently not supported.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have previously purchased your own certificate, you can install it manually in the panel:</p>

</li>
<li>On the next page you can select a free Let's Encrypt or paid Sectigo certificate.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2><span id="lets_encrypt">Option #1 — Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The first option is to add a FREE 'Let's Encrypt' certificate. This is just as secure as a paid certificate. The only difference is that it does not have the same seal of trust which some users prefer to display to their visitors.</p>
<p>This option is recommended for simple websites such as a WordPress blog and other non-critical public content.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216539548-Adding-a-free-Let-s-Encrypt-certificate">Adding a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="comodo">Option #2 — Sectigo verified SSL ($15/year)</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 references Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificate issued prior to this date references Comodo. Both names <a href="https://sectigo.com/comodo" target="_self">refer to the same company</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The second option allows you to add a paid Sectigo SSL certificate, which costs $15/year.</p>
<p>The advantages of a Sectigo SSL certificate over the other options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's professionally signed by Sectigo and displays a certificate seal of trust.</li>
<li>it's recommended for ecommerce sites, customer login areas, and any other critical public content.</li>
<li>gives your visitors the best indication that your website is secure and the connection is safe.</li>
<li>provides a&nbsp;<a href="https://ssl.comodo.com/comodossl-ov-renewal" target="_self" rel="undefined">certificate warranty</a>&nbsp;if it fails to properly validate the information contained in a digital certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for full instructions on how to add this certificate:</p>

<h3>Signed SSL Certificate Seal</h3>
<p>For the signed SSL certificates purchased in the DreamHost panel (through Sectigo), you can use this seal graphic on your site:</p>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You can copy the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in your panel and use it to purchase your signed SSL certificate from another Certificate Authority if you have not chosen to purchase one from DreamHost.</p>
</div>

</div>
<h2>How long after adding the certificate will HTTPS function?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After adding an SSL certificate, it could take a few minutes to a few hours for <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> to work on your domain. This depends on the certificate type you added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's Encrypt&nbsp;— Can take 10-30 minutes to set up</li>
<li>Professionally-signed&nbsp;— These could potentially take several hours to set up</li>
</ul>
