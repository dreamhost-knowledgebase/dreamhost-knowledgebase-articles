<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page. A list of your domains display.</li>

<li>On the next page, select a free Let's Encrypt or paid Sectigo certificate.</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p><strong>How long after adding the certificate will HTTPS function?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let's Encrypt&nbsp;— Can take 10-30 minutes to set up</li>
<li>Professionally-signed&nbsp;— These could potentially take several hours to set up</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="h_01HQC4RS1WFZJPFTTT82MJN5B0"><span id="lets_encrypt">Option #1 — Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</span></h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Let's Encrypt certificates are recommended for simple websites such as a WordPress blog and other non-critical public content.</p>
<p>They are just as secure as paid certificates. The only difference is that they do not have the same seal of trust that some users prefer to display to their visitors.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HQC4RS1WPEM76DQB150B8JEF"><span id="comodo">Option #2 — Sectigo verified SSL ($15/year)</span></h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Sectigo certificates are recommended for eCommerce sites, customer login areas, and any other critical public content.</p>
<p>The advantages of a Sectigo SSL certificate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's professionally signed by Sectigo and displays a certificate seal of trust.</li>
<li>gives your visitors the best indication that your website is secure and the connection is safe.</li>
<li>provides a&nbsp;<a href="https://ssl.comodo.com/comodossl-ov-renewal" target="_self" rel="undefined">certificate warranty</a>&nbsp;if it fails to properly validate the information contained in a digital certificate.</li>
</ul>
