<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following describes how to add an SSL certificate to your domain.</p>
<p>However, adding a certificate is only the first step in the process of making your site secure. In order to see a secure padlock in your browser’s address bar, you must also complete each of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a valid SSL certificate to the site (described in the following sections).</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747758-Force-your-site-to-load-securely-with-an-htaccess-file">Load your site via a secure HTTPS URL</a>.</li>

</ol>
</div>
<h2>Types of SSL certificates</h2>
<div class="solvvy-hidden">
<p>There are two types of SSL certificates you can add to your domain within the DreamHost panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#lets_encrypt">Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#comodo">Sectigo verified SSL ($15/year)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview" target="_self">Nameservers</a> are NOT hosted at DreamHost, you must ensure that your records are compatible with DreamHost before adding the SSL certificate to your domain. You have the following two options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Completely remove your CAA records at your current hosting company</li>
<li>Remove any conflicting CAA records at your current hosting company before adding an SSL certificate in the DreamHost panel.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to retain your CAA records, make sure to view the following article for further details on which records should remain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029281672-CAA-policy-records">CAA policy records</a></li>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page. A list of your domains display.

</dl>
</li>
<li>On the next page you can select a free Let's Encrypt or paid Sectigo certificate.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2><span id="lets_encrypt">Option #1 — Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The first option is to add a FREE 'Let's Encrypt' certificate. This is just as secure as a paid certificate. The only difference is that it does not have the same seal of trust which some users prefer to display to their visitors.</p>
<p>This option is recommended for simple websites such as a WordPress blog and other non-critical public content.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216539548-Adding-a-free-Let-s-Encrypt-certificate">Adding a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="comodo">Option #2 — Sectigo verified SSL ($15/year)</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 references Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificate issued prior to this date references Comodo. Both names <a href="https://sectigo.com/comodo" target="_self">refer to the same company</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second option allows you to add a paid Sectigo SSL certificate, which costs $15/year.</p>
<p>The advantages of a Sectigo SSL certificate over the other options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's professionally signed by Sectigo and displays a certificate seal of trust.</li>
<li>it's recommended for ecommerce sites, customer login areas, and any other critical public content.</li>
<li>gives your visitors the best indication that your website is secure and the connection is safe.</li>
<li>provides a&nbsp;<a href="https://ssl.comodo.com/support/ssl-technical-faqs/what-does-the-warranty-actually-mean.php">certificate warranty</a>&nbsp;if it fails to properly validate the information contained in a digital certificate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signed SSL Certificate Seal</h3>
<p>For the signed SSL certificates purchased in the DreamHost panel (through Sectigo), you can use this seal graphic on your site:</p>

<h2>How long after adding the certificate will HTTPS function?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After adding an SSL certificate, it could take a few minutes to a few hours for <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> to work on your domain. This depends on the certificate type you added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's Encrypt&nbsp;— Can take 10-30 minutes to set up</li>
<li>Professionally-signed&nbsp;— These could potentially take several hours to set up</li>
</ul>
