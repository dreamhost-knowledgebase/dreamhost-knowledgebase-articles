<h2>Types of SSL certificates</h2>
<p>There are three types of SSL certificates you can add to your domain within the DreamHost panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#comodo">Comodo verified SSL ($15/year)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#self_signed">Self-signed SSL (FREE)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#lets_encrypt">Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537#Wildcard_certificates">Wildcard certificates</a> are currently not supported.</p>
<p>If you have previously purchased your own certificate, you can install it manually in the panel:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Adding an SSL certificate</h2>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Secure Hosting')</a> page. The top section titled 'Active SSL certificates' lists any active SSL certificates for your domains.</p>
<p><em>The next section titled 'Add a new SSL certificate' lists three options to add an SSL to your domain:</em></p>

<h2><span id="comodo">Option #1 — Comodo verified SSL ($15/year)</span></h2>
<p>The first option allows you to add a paid Comodo SSL certificate, which costs $15/year.</p>
<p>The advantages of a Comodo SSL certificate over the other options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>it's professionally signed by Comodo and displays a certificate seal of trust.</li>
<li>it's recommended for ecommerce sites, customer login areas, and any other critical public content.</li>
<li>gives your visitors the best indication that your website is secure and the connection is safe.</li>
<li>provides a <a href="https://ssl.comodo.com/support/ssl-technical-faqs/what-does-the-warranty-actually-mean.php">certificate warranty</a> if it fails to properly validate the information contained in a digital certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p> View the following article for full instructions on how to add this certificate:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Signed SSL Certificate Seal</h3>
<p>For the signed SSL certificates purchased in the DreamHost panel (through Comodo), you can use this seal graphic on your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.positivessl.com/site_seals.php">https://www.positivessl.com/site_seals.php</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="self_signed">Option #2 — Self-signed SSL (FREE)</span></h2>
<p>The second option allows you to add a FREE Self-signed certificate. This is not recommended since web browsers display a warning when visiting the site:</p>

<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_SSL_troubleshooting.png" alt="01 SSL troubleshooting.png" width="419" height="380" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Self-signed certificates are also vulnerable to '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-in-the-middle</a>' attacks. For these reasons, this option is only recommended for a company intranet, internal login areas, and other private content where the site administrator can ensure security. It's not recommended for public facing websites. View the following article for instructions on how to add this certificate.</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="lets_encrypt">Option #3 — Let's Encrypt SSL (FREE)</span></h2>
<p>The third option is to add a FREE 'Let's Encrypt' certificate. This is just as secure as a paid certificate. The only difference is that it does not have the same seal of trust which some users prefer to display to their visitors.</p>
<p>This option is recommended for simple websites such as a WordPress blog and other non-critical public content.</p>

<h2>How long after adding the certificate will HTTPS function?</h2>
<p>After adding an SSL certificate, it could take a few minutes to a few hours for HTTPS to work on your domain. This depends on the certificate type you added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-signed — Functions immediately</li>
<li>Let's Encrypt — Can take 10-30 minutes to set up</li>
<li>Professionally-signed — These could potentially take several hours to set up</li>
</ul>
