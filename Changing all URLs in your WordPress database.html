<p>WordPress hardcodes the site's domain name into the database in such things as image and link urls. This is a problem if you migrate the site to another domain, because when you click on a link on your new site, it redirects back to the old site.</p>
<p>To update the URLs in your database, you can use a plugin or command line</p>
<h2>Using a plugin</h2>
<p>Below are a couple of plugins that work to change all URLs in your database.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velvet-blues-update-urls/">Velvet Blues Update URLs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-and-replace/">Search and Replace</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-search-replace/">Better Search Replace</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Using the command line</h2>
<p>If you are familiar with the command line, you can run the following command for the same effect (assuming you saved the old WordPress address).</p>
<ol>
<li>First, log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Next, navigate to your WordPress installation. Assuming it's 'example.com', you'd probably run the following:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cd ~/example.com</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>In your site's directory, you can use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214693248-WordPress-wp-cli-overview">wp-cli</a> to update the URLs using the following command.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">wp search-replace http://example.com http://new.example.com --dry-run</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The --dry-run call at the end tests the address</p>
<p>If the changes make sense to you, then run the above command again without the 'dry-run' call.</p>
<p>At this point, all URLs within your WordPress site will use the new domain name.</p>
