<p>After you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001154012-Copying-your-DreamPress-site-to-Staging-to-test-changes" target="_self">tested your staging site</a> and have confirmed it's functioning as it should, you can then push those changes to your&nbsp;live website with just one click.
