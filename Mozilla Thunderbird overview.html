<p><strong>Mozilla Thunderbird</strong> is an open source mail client and RSS reader made by the organization who produces the Mozilla Firefox web browser. This is a free email client you can use with DreamHost. It can also be used as a backup client for testing purposes if you find your primary client is not functioning as it should.</p>

<h2><span id="Viewing_message_headers">Viewing message headers</span></h2>
<p>The Thunderbird mail program refers to the full message headers of a message as the “source”. In some cases, you may need to retrieve the full header (or “source”) details of a message.</p>
<p>To view the full header details of a message:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the message from the mailbox.</li>
<li>In the far right corner of the message, click the Other Actions menu.</li>
<li>In the drop-down options that appear for this message, select the View Source option.</li>
</ol>
<p>This opens a new window with the full header details of the message you choose.</p>

<h3><span id="Some_of_my_IMAP_folders_don.27t_show_on_Thunderbird._How_do_I_fix_this.3F">Some of my IMAP folders don't show on Thunderbird. How do I fix this?</span></h3>
<p>Make sure that you have subscribed to them!</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the account in the left panel and choose 'Subscribe'.
<dl>
<dd><em>The Subscribe box opens which shows you the default folders to which you are already subscribed. In this example, only the ‘Test’ folder is remaining to subscribe.</em></dd>
<dd><img alt="Subscribe folders.fw.png" height="335" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Subscribe_folders.fw.png" width="386"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Check the box for that folder and then click the <strong>Subscribe</strong> button to add that folder as an accessible folder through Thunderbird.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> when finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can also do the following to make your IMAP folders appear in Thunderbird:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go back to the "Advanced Account Settings" panel (Tools or Edit -&gt; Account Settings... -&gt; Server Settings -&gt; Advanced... button).</li>
<li>Uncheck "Show only subscribed folders".</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on that pop-up box. Click <strong>OK</strong> on the 'Advanced Server Settings' box you originally opened.</li>
<li>In the left pane of Thunderbird's main window, click the triangle icon to the left of the email address. Collapse and un-collapse the account you edited.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes Thunderbird re-read all of the folders on that account.</p>
