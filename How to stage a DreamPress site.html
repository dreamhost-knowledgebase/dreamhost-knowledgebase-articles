<h2>Best practices</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Password protecting your staging site</h3>
<p>Search engines will penalize your site for duplicate content. To avoid this, your staging site is automatically password-protected so it does not lose SEO ranking.</p>
<p>HTTP Auth/Password Protection cannot be disabled.</p>
<h3>Copying changes to your live site</h3>
<p>Be careful when you copy from your staging site to your live site: you could potentially lose/overwrite any changes on your live site you've made since you started working on the staging site.</p>
<p>If you do choose to copy from the staging site, make sure to backup your live site just to be safe.</p>
