<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Some anti-virus software can cause the payment fields to not appear on the <span class="panel-page">Manage Payments</span> page. If you encounter this issue while using Kaspersky Anti-Virus, try adding the DreamHost panel webpage to Kaspersky's Safe Money list and then reloading the page. Please see the Kaspersky documentation linked below for more information:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you're using different anti-virus software and encounter this issue, try disabling your antivirus software and reloading the page.</p>
</div>
<p>Payments must be made through your DreamHost panel, which offers a secure way to transmit payment data.</p>
<p>To make a payment, navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.payment&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Payments</a> page:</p>

</dl>
<p>You can select the following payment options, which are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit/Debit Card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and Diners Club)</li>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Electronic Check / ACH</li>
<li>Rewards Credit</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You can use pre-paid cards to make payments on an existing DreamHost account, but cannot use them to create a new DreamHost account. However, be aware that if you make a payment using a pre-paid card, DreamHost may not be able to process a refund back to the card.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HMJ42KSKBVQ6NJ8JF32NDJ1A">Setting up AutoPay</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>After you set up a card for AutoPay, you can then use the card on file to make one-time purchases (such as domain registrations) without needing to enter the payment information again.</p>
</div>
<p>You can set up AutoPay using PayPal or a credit/debit card to pay for DreamHost services. The advantage of setting up AutoPay is that DreamHost will automatically charge your card whenever a payment is due, which saves you time and hassle in paying for recurring charges every month.</p>
