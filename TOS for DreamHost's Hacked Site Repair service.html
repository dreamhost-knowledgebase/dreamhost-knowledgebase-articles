<p>The following is a description of DreamHost's Terms of Service (TOS) for the Hacked Site Repair service.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQ27D9MVCQKPBFPNWD">Turnaround time</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost endeavors to fully repair your website within 48 hours from the time your payment is received.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The 48-hour timeline depends on your active participation and timely replies to any DreamHost emails.</p>
</div>
<p>DreamHost asks that you reply to any of its emails within 12 hours to ensure a prompt repair of your site. If a reply is not received from you within 12 hours, then the repair is effectively "paused” until DreamHost hears back. DreamHost will still do its best to complete the process as soon as possible from that point on.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQV38TDAZYSP6E4S80">Compatibility</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At this time, DreamHost’s Hacked Site Repair service is only available for single-site WordPress installations hosted on DreamHost shared, VPS, DreamPress, and managed Dedicated Server platforms. The service encompasses one website.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQXRW3CH7QS84WJSZH">Third-party software</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In some cases, closed source or premium licensed software, such as themes, plugins, scripts, and so on, may be damaged and must be replaced. Under such circumstances, DreamHost may at its sole discretion remove or deactivate such software, which may need to be reinstalled by a licensee. You understand and agree that DreamHost is not responsible for any issues arising from the removal or deactivation of such software.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQPYSKVXP05ETZ703Y">Customer data and disk usage</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The storage systems on DreamHost web servers are specifically intended to support hosted websites and are not designed as an efficient backup or storage solution. Please note that DreamHost’s <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy/">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/unlimited-policy/">Unlimited Policy</a> applies to any and all hacked site repairs.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQ9RPK8Y3S8MDJHPTJ"><span id="refund_policy">Refund policy</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The one-time charge for the Hacked Site Repair service is refundable if DreamHost is unable to repair your website within the quoted time frame as a result of DreamHost's own internal delays. However, the following activities nullifies any claim to a refund:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failing to respond to any information requests and emails for more than 12 hours once the repair process is initiated.</li>
<li>Interference with the repair process or taking over the repair process yourself.</li>
<li>New compromises or malicious activity after a cleanup is completed.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQCXYC974MAKXQ8ECF">No guarantee</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>While DreamHost strives to do its best during the repair, please note that perfect results are never guaranteed. This is a manual process that varies based on the unique situations every website faces. That said, DreamHost will do its very best to repair your website. Once a site is repaired, it is solely the responsibility of the site owner to maintain the site including any and all site software, components, and credentials. You understand and agree that DreamHost is not responsible for any damages or issues that arise from the Hacked Site Repair service.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQXGXF7C8XSY1XJW8Y">Single site per user</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Prior to requesting the Hacked Site Repair service, you must ensure that the site is isolated under its own unique FTP/SFTP/SSH username. Should a site be under a user with other content, DreamHost at its sole discretion may move a site being cleaned to a new SFTP user.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQ4ANA0GRJARVS04ZQ">Cancellation</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you decide to cancel the 'Hacked Site Repair' service for any reason, please let DreamHost know promptly so its support team can prevent any interference with your own site activity and plans. Keep in mind, a refund is not available if DreamHost has already initiated the process (see <a href="#refund_policy">Refund policy</a>&nbsp;above).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXTGNAGQJ17TZZYWZ8MCSMQ4">Notice</h2>
