<p>In general, recovering from an exploit requires consideration of:</p>
<ol>
<li>locating the source</li>
<li>closing the security hole</li>
<li>removing backdoors, and</li>
<li>cleaning up the damage.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following is an overview of the process of clearing up any exploits on your account.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is most vulnerable?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following are common items that are most vulnerable on your website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outdated web applications and associated themes and plugins are often the point of entry for most exploits. Keeping all web applications, themes, and plugins updated to their latest versions helps to eliminate known security vulnerabilities. If you're unsure if there are security concerns related to any web application that you are using, you can search for advisories related to known vulnerabilities here:

</li>
<li>Web applications may have had their admin passwords compromised or malicious users added without your knowledge. DreamHost strongly recommends that you log into your applications to audit for unknown added users and change any passwords for admin-privileged users if you suspect that your site is hacked.</li>
