<p>A self-signed certificate is an SSL certificate that has not been validated by a Certificate Authority (CA). That's what meant in that it is 'self' signed.</p>
<p>The level of encryption can be the same as any other certificate, but because it's not validated by a CA, the browser will display a warning when visiting the site.</p>
<p>For this reason, these types of certificates are only recommended for internal use on your website where no visitor would ever see or come into contact with. </p>
<h2><span id="self_signed_warnings">Browser warnings for self-signed certificates</span></h2>
<p>Because a trusted authority did not sign it, browsers cannot trust it. It will still function normally, but visitors to your site will see a warning. Below are examples of what a visitor would see in Firefox and Chrome.</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you want to attract visitors to your site, <strong>DO NOT</strong> use a self-signed certificate.</p>

<h2>Creating a self-signed certificate</h2>
<p>There is no way in the DreamHost panel to add a self-signed certificate. You have two options to create this type of cert.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create it via SSH command line</li>
<li>3rd party website</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a self-signed certificate via SSH</h3>
<p>You can run these commands on a Linux or Mac computer, however these instructions show how to log into your DreamHost web server to run the commands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your DreamHost web server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Connect to your domain via SSH. Visit the SSH article for instructions.</li>
<li>Once logged into your server via SSH, make sure you're in your user's home directory:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cd ~</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Use OpenSSL to create your private key which you will use to create the CSR. Type in the following to open the OpenSSL command line tool.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">openssl</span></pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>Your command prompt now changes to OpenSSL&gt; which means you’re ready to run the following commands.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Generate a new RSA private key by entering the following command without a password:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">OpenSSL&gt; </span><span class="command">genrsa -out Private.key 2048</span>
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
........................................................+++
........................................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Using this new private key, create the certificate.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">OpenSSL&gt; </span><span class="command">req -new -x509 -key Private.key -out Certificate.crt -days 365</span>
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
Email Address []:</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>The step above asks you for your site information to create a CSR. You can just click through these options without entering anything since your browser will throw a warning for the Self-Signed certificate by default.</li>
<li>Log out of OpenSSL
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">OpenSSL&gt;</span><span class="command"> quit</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Check to confirm your private key and certificate have been created.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ls -1</span>
Certificate.crt
Private.key</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that the private key and certificate have been created, you can install them in your panel using the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089668-How-do-I-install-a-third-party-SSL-certificate-">How do I install a third-party SSL certificate?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Using SSH, you can open the files to view their contents by running cat:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cat Certificate.crt</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cat Private.key</span></pre>
</div>
<h3>Creating a self-signed cert with an online website</h3>
<p>There are several websites that allow you to create a self-signed certificate within it such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sslchecker.com/csr/self_signed">https://www.sslchecker.com/csr/self_signed</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS be default</h2>
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in 'https' before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (https).</p>
