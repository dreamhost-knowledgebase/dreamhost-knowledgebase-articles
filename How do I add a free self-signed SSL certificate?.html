<p>A self-signed certificate is an SSL certificate that has not been validated by a Certificate Authority (CA). That's what meant in that it is 'self' signed.</p>
<p>The level of encryption can be the same as any other certificate, but because it's not validated by a CA, the browser will display a warning when visiting the site.</p>
<p>For this reason, these types of certificates are only recommended for internal use on your website where no visitor would ever see or come into contact with.Â </p>
<h2><span id="self_signed_warnings">Browser warnings for self-signed certificates</span></h2>
<p>Because a trusted authority did not sign it, browsers cannot trust it. It will still function normally, but visitors to your site will see a warning. Below are examples of what a visitor would see in Firefox and Chrome.</p>

<h2>Creating a self-signed certificate</h2>
<p>There is no way in the DreamHost panel to add a self-signed certificate. You have two options to create this type of cert.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create it via SSH command line</li>
<li>3rd party website</li>
</ul>
<p>Once created, you can then import it into your site in the DreamHost panel using the following article:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS be default</h2>
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in 'https' before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (https).</p>
