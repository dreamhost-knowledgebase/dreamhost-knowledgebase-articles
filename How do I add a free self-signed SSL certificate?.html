<p>Before attempting to set up Secure Hosting, please familiarize yourself with the information in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">Secure Hosting</a> article. It's crucial that the initial configuration is done correctly as there are some parameters that cannot be changed afterward without completely removing and then re-adding Secure Hosting from your domain.</p>
<p>Once you familiarize yourself with the information in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-Secure-Hosting-overview">Secure Hosting</a> article, proceed with the following steps to add your SSL certificate. </p>
<h2><span id="self_signed_warnings">Browser warnings for self-signed certificates</span></h2>
<p>A self-signed certificate is <strong>NOT</strong> signed by a trusted authority. That's what meant in that it is 'self' signed. Because a trusted authority did not sign it, browsers cannot trust it. It will still function normally, but visitors to your site will see a warning. Below are examples of what a visitor would see in Firefox and Chrome.</p>

<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS be default</h2>
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in 'https' before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (https).</p>
