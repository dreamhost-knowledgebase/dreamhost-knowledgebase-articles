<p>This article describes how to adjust the email storage limit on your mail server. For information about sending quota limits, view the following article:</p>

<p>When changing/removing disk limits (quotas), it will take about 15 minutes for the changes to be pushed to the live servers.</p>
</div>
<p>If your account reaches/exceeds its disk limit, and you've made a change via the panel, you may want to contact support through a ticket or by starting a “Chat Live” session (using the <strong>Chat Live</strong> button on any page of the panel) and request if support can expedite the change for you.</p>

<h2>General consideration of the email storage limit</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Whenever you create a new email user account, you’re given the option to limit the total disk usage. By default, this is set to 200MB. DreamHost recommends that if you do set a limit, raise that number if you're expecting to store/save a lot of mail through that new email address and leave it on DreamHost's servers (as opposed to downloading it off the server using a POP3 connection).</p>
<p>Total disk usage of 200 MB is usually a good amount for regular mail, but when it comes to HTML mail and attachments, you'll quickly reach that limit which causes errors until it's changed. If you set a limit and then later you need to change it or remove it entirely, you can do so by editing the email address on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> page.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>DreamHost recommends that you never set an email account with a disk limit below 100MB as most email clients require some free space in order to operate (even to delete messages). If an email account reaches/exceeds its disk limit, it displays errors and bounce incoming messages. If that happens, you'll need to increase/remove the disk limit in order to get it working again.</p>
<p>However, DreamHost also does not not recommended storing over 1000MB of mail as this could cause connection failures in Webmail when attempting to load your Inbox.</p>
</div>
<p>DreamHost mail servers allow incoming messages as large as 40MB, and a couple of large messages can easily fill your account very quickly if its has a very low disk limit. For more information on incoming message limitations, see the following article:</p>
