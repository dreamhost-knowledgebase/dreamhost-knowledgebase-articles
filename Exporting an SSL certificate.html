<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can export the contents of your SSL certificate by manually copying the certificate and key files in your panel to your home computer. Please note that there is currently not an automated way to export your SSL certificate into a single file.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Only Sectigo certificates can be used on another server. Let's Encrypt certificates only function on the server they were issued to.</p>

<h2>Creating a .pem file</h2>
