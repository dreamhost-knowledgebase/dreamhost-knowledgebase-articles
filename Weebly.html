<p>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, you can point it to Weebly using A records:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your domain is set to DNS only. Visit the following articles for further details:
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215414867-How-do-I-add-custom-DNS-records-">Custom DNS</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once it's set to DNS only, add Weebly's DNS records. You'll need to add two A records. The following article explains how to add these records:

</dl>
</li>
<li>Add the A record with a blank hostname.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Add the same A record with the 'www' hostname.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once those records are saved, it may take 6 hrs or more to update online. You can check the status of your DNS changes using either of the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatsmydns.net</a> — A popular site that checks DNS records around the world.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360055964552-Viewing-your-DreamHost-DNS-records" target="_self">Viewing your DreamHost DNS records</a> — Use DreamHost's DNS propagation checker in the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the DNS has updated, your site is ready to be hosted at Weebly.</p>
