<p>If your domain is registered at DreamHost, you can point it to Weebly using two 'A' records. Before you begin, please review how to move hosting to another company (see Option #2 in the following article):</p>

</ul>
<p>Use the following steps to point your domain to Weebly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your domain is set to DNS only. Visit the following articles for further details:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Once it's set to DNS only, review the following article to learn how to add custom 'A' records using Weebly's DNS records:

</ul>
</li>
<li>Create TWO 'A' records (using both a <em>blank</em> and a 'www' hostnames). Use the <strong>Add More +</strong> button to add more records:

<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-dns-a-record-add-02.png" alt="Add A Record" width="526" height="233" /></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Record #1: An 'A' record with a <em>blank</em> hostname.</li>
<li>Record #2: An 'A' record with the 'www' hostname.</li>
<li>Records #1 and #2: <a href="http://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/201372693-How-to-Use-a-Domain-You-Purchased-Elsewhere" target="_self">Contact Weebly</a> to obtain the correct IP address and then enter it into the 'Points to' field box.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once those records are saved, it may take 6 hrs or more to update online. You can check the status of your DNS changes using either of the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatsmydns.net</a> — A popular site that checks DNS records around the world.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360055964552-Viewing-your-DreamHost-DNS-records" target="_self">Viewing your DreamHost DNS records</a> — Use DreamHost's DNS propagation checker in the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the DNS has updated, your site is ready to be hosted at Weebly.</p>
