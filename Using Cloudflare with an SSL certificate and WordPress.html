<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Adding an SSL certificate to your WordPress site is an excellent first step toward securing your data. You also have the option to add Cloudflare to your domain in addition to your SSL certificate. This allows you to take advantage of Cloudflare's services, while also continuing to secure your website. The following sections walk you through how to ensure Cloudflare is properly set up for your WordPress site.</p>

<p>Your site must use the 'www' version of the URL. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>www.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your site is currently NOT using the 'www' version, make sure that <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218428687#update-database-urls" target="_self">when you update the URLs in your database</a>, you also include the www as part of the updated URL.</p>
<p>If you do not add www at this time, your site will throw a redirect error message after Cloudflare is added.</p>
