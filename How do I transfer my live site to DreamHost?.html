<p><strong>Registration transfer</strong></p>
<p>This article explains how to transfer your website's data to DreamHost. This is separate from your domain registration.</p>
<p>You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to transfer your registration to DreamHost during this process. You can always transfer it at any time in the future. View the following article when you are ready to also transfer your registration:</p>

<h2>Create a DreamHost account</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before proceeding, make sure you have created a DreamHost account by signing up for a hosting plan. View the following article for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">How to signup for a DreamHost account?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During the signup process, select the option <span class="text-object">I already have a domain</span>. This allows you to add your current domain name to your new DreamHost account.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Adding your domain to DreamHost at this point does <strong>NOT</strong> affect your current live website in any way. It will remain functioning normally at your current host until you point your DNS records in Step #4.</p>

<h2>Step 1 — Back up your data from your old hosting company</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This step backs up the data from your old hosting company to your home computer.</p>
<img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/transfer-live-site-01.svg" />
<p>You'll need to back up the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website files</li>
<li>Database file (only if your site uses a database)</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Make sure your database is exported to a file with the extension <span class="text-object">.sql</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Contact your old hosting company for their instructions on how to back up this content. They may have a simple way to export the data. If not, you'll need to back everything up manually.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="steps-section--step">
<div id="step2" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<img class="steps-number-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/number-2.svg" alt="" width="50px" />
<h2>Step 2 — Upload the data to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This step uploads the data from your home computer to your new DreamHost account.</p>
<img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/transfer-live-site-02.svg" />
<h3>Website files</h3>
<p>You can use an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613107-List-of-FTP-client-software" target="_self">FTP client</a> to log into your new DreamHost server and upload your website files.

</ul>
<h3>Database file</h3>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>This step is only necessary if your website uses a database.</p>
</div>
<p>Your database should have been backed up into a single file ending with the extension <span class="text-object">.sql</span>. View the following article for instructions on how to import this database file into your DreamHost account.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to import the emails you downloaded from your old hosting company into your new DreamHost mail server.</p>

<h2>Step 3 — View your site at DreamHost (before pointing DNS)</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This step allows you to view how your site will appear at DreamHost before you point your DNS. This does not affect your live site at all. It just offers you the ability to confirm your site is configured properly at DreamHost before pointing its DNS.</p>
<img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/transfer-live-site-03.svg" />
<p>Even though you have uploaded your website content to DreamHost, it's still hosted at your old hosting company. This means that when you view it in a browser, it appears as it does at your old host, not DreamHost. It will only load from your DreamHost server after you point its DNS records to DreamHost.</p>
<p>Before you point the DNS records, you should test the site to confirm it looks and functions as intended on your new DreamHost server.</p>
<h3>Update your computer's host file</h3>
<p>The best way to view your site as it appears on your DreamHost server is to update the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file on your home computer. This is a file that already exists on your computer. Its job is to map a domain name to an IP address. In this way, you can force your home computer to load the website from your DreamHost server, even though it's still hosted at your old hosting company.</p>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to update the hosts file on your computer to point to DreamHost.</p>

</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>After you have confirmed your site is functioning correctly, make sure to remove the lines you just added when testing.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="steps-section--step">
<div id="step4" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<img class="steps-number-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/number-4.svg" alt="" width="50px" />
<h2>Step 4 — Point your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This step points your website's DNS records to DreamHost. This is the final step to host your website on your new DreamHost server.</p>
<img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/transfer-live-site-04.svg" />
<p>At this point, your website is correctly configured on your DreamHost server, but it is loading from the server at your old hosting company.</p>
<p>To load your site from your DreamHost server, you must now point its DNS records to DreamHost. You have two options when pointing your DNS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Point the nameservers (recommended)</li>
<li>Point the A records</li>
</ul>
<h3>What records should I point?</h3>
<p>It does not matter which option you choose. A records and nameservers will function the same way to load your website.&nbsp;The only difference is that pointing your nameservers is much more simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nameservers (recommended)</strong></p>
<p>Pointing your nameservers is easier because it automatically points all of your other records to DreamHost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following articles explain more about nameservers, how to view where they are pointed, and how to point them to DreamHost.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-How-do-I-change-my-nameservers-at-my-current-host-">How do I change my nameservers at my current host?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Records</strong></p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Pointing A Records is only recommended if you need to keep specific services active at your old hosting company. If you want to point all of your DNS records for this domain, it's recommended to point your nameservers instead.</p>
</div>
<p>Pointing your A Records is more difficult because there are multiple A Records for each type of service you use. For example, you'll need to update records for your:</p>
<ul>
<li>website</li>
<li>database</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>custom records you require</li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to view the IP addresses at DreamHost you'll need to point your A Records to.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DreamHost-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">What DreamHost DNS records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You'll then need to check with your old hosting company for instructions on how to update these records.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Wait for the DNS records to update</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After pointing your DNS records to DreamHost, they will need time to propagate online.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS propagation overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A Records could take 6 hours to update, but nameservers could take up to 72 hours to fully update. Until all records are pointed to DreamHost, your site will still load from your old hosting company.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>It is not possible to speed up this process since servers throughout the world update records on their own schedule.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the DNS records have updated online, your website will load as it is configured on your DreamHost server.</p>
