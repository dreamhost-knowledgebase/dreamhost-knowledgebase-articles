<p>This article does not explain how to transfer the domain registration – only the hosting of your domain's files. View the following article if you also would like to transfer your registration:</p>

<h2>Step one: Create a DreamHost account</h2>

</dl>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for any DreamHost plan [<a href="https://signup.dreamhost.com/">here</a>]. View the following article for details:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">How to signup for a DreamHost account?</a></li>
</ul>
<li>During the signup process, select the option to add your current domain to your new account. <strong>This does NOT affect your current live website</strong>.</li>
<li>Finish the signup process.
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img height="60" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>DreamHost sends you a 'request to transfer the registration' after you complete the sign up, as well as information on how to access your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> account. You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to transfer your registration. It can remain at your current registrar for now. You can always transfer it at a later date.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step two: Backup your website files and upload them to DreamHost</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="transfer_site_toDH_02.fw.png" height="209" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_02.fw.png" width="617"/></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Backup all of your website files, databases, and emails from your old host via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217213327-Wget">Wget</a>. Contact your old host for their instructions on how to back up this content at their company.</li>
<li>Log in to your DreamHost server using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP client</a>. Once logged in, you’ll be able to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613657-How-do-I-upload-my-site-to-DreamHost-">upload your website files to the server</a>.
<dl>
<dd><img alt="transfer_site_toDH_03.fw.png" height="209" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_03.fw.png" width="617"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Use the information in the following articles to upload your MySQL database and email to your DreamHost servers.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215039938-How-do-I-migrate-my-database-to-DreamHost-">Migrate MySQL</a></li>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step three: Viewing your site at DreamHost before updating DNS</h2>
<p>Now that your website has been migrated to DreamHost's servers, it's time to check the site to confirm it looks and functions as intended. View the following article for information on how to create a 'Mirror' domain. This allows you to see your site as it appears on DreamHost's servers before updating your DNS at your current host:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Previewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">Previewing your site with a dreamhosters.com subdomain before changing DNS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to create a 'Mirror' domain, you can also view your site using the 'hosts' file on your home computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006086308-How-to-view-your-DreamHost-site-using-your-hosts-file">How to view your DreamHost site using your hosts file</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Step four: Point your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="transfer_site_toDH_04.fw.png" height="209" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_04.fw.png" width="617"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>At this point your website and all its files are on DreamHost's servers, but your site is still 'hosted' at your old hosting company. You must now update your DNS to point to DreamHost. View the following article for instructions on how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">What DNS records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the DNS is resolving to DreamHost, visiting your site displays the site as it appears on your DreamHost server.</p>
