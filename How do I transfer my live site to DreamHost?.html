<h2><span id="stepthree">Step 3 — Viewing your site at DreamHost before updating DNS</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Now that your website has been migrated to DreamHost's servers, it's time to check the site to confirm it looks and functions as intended. View the following article for information on how to create a 'Mirror' domain. This allows you to see your site as it appears on DreamHost's servers before updating your DNS at your current host:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you do not want to create a 'Mirror' domain, you can also view your site using the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file on your home computer.</p>

</dl>
<p>At this point your website and all its files are on DreamHost's servers, but your site is still 'hosted' at your old hosting company. You must now update your DNS to point to DreamHost. View the following article for instructions on how to do this:</p>

<p>Once the DNS is resolving to DreamHost, visiting your site displays the site as it appears on your DreamHost server.</p>
