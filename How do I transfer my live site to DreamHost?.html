<p>This article describes how to transfer your website and email hosting from your old provider to DreamHost. When you update your DNS, your site is then live on DreamHost's servers.</p>

<p>This article does not explain how to transfer the domain registration – only the hosting of your domain's files. View the following article if you also would like to transfer your registration:</p>

</dl>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for any DreamHost plan [<a href="https://signup.dreamhost.com/">here</a>]. View the following article for details:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">How to signup for a DreamHost account?</a></li>
</ul>
<li>During the signup process, select the option to add your current domain to your new account. <strong>This does NOT affect your current live website</strong>.</li>
<li>Finish the signup process.

<div class="alert-content">
<p>DreamHost sends you a 'request to transfer the registration' after you complete the sign up, as well as information on how to access your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> account. You do <strong>NOT</strong> need to transfer your registration. It can remain at your current registrar for now. You can always transfer it at a later date.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Step two: Backup your website files and upload them to DreamHost</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_02.fw.png" alt="transfer_site_toDH_02.fw.png" width="617" height="209" /></dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Backup all of your website files, databases, and emails from your old host via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217213327-Wget">Wget</a>. Contact your old host for their instructions on how to back up this content at their company.</li>
<li>Log in to your DreamHost <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP account</a>. Once logged in to your DreamHost server, you’ll be able to upload your website files to the server.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Use the information in the following articles to upload your MySQL database and email to your DreamHost servers.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215039938-How-do-I-migrate-my-database-to-DreamHost-">Migrate MySQL</a></li>

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Step three: Viewing your site at DreamHost before updating DNS</h2>
<p>Now that your website has been migrated to DreamHost's servers, it's time to check the site to confirm it looks and functions as intended. View the following article for information on how to create a 'Mirror' domain. This allows you to see your site as it appears on DreamHost's servers before updating your DNS at your current host:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Viewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">Viewing your site with a dreamhosters.com subdomain before changing DNS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to create a 'Mirror' domain, you can also view your site using the 'hosts' file on your home computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006086308-How-to-view-your-DreamHost-site-using-your-hosts-file">How to view your DreamHost site using your hosts file</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Step four: Point your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/transfer_site_toDH_04.fw.png" alt="transfer_site_toDH_04.fw.png" width="617" height="209" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>At this point your website and all its files are on DreamHost's servers, but your site is still 'hosted' at your old hosting company. You must now update your DNS to point to DreamHost. You have two options:</p>
<h3>Option #1 — Pointing your nameservers</h3>
<p>This options points all of your DNS records to DreamHost including email. Only use this option if you want all of your website's services hosted at DreamHost.</p>
<p>Return to your old host and set the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-How-do-I-change-my-nameservers-at-my-current-host-">nameservers</a>' for your domain registration to point to DreamHost using these nameservers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40" style="color: #aaa;">64.90.62.230</span></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40" style="color: #aaa;">208.97.182.10</span></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40" style="color: #aaa;">66.33.205.230</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>When updating your nameservers at your registrar, you should only have to add the nameserver URL, not the IP. The IPs are listed above just in case your registrar asks for them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>This modification takes about 3–72 hours to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> across the Internet, after which your new nameservers will direct visitors to your account with DreamHost.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">https://www.whatsmydns.net/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Option #2 — Pointing your A records</h3>
<p>This option allows you to only point your site's A records (IP addresses) to DreamHost. Use this option if you are hosting email at another company and only want your website hosted at DreamHost. View the following article for instructions on how to find your site's IP addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DreamHost DNS overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the DNS is resolving to DreamHost, visiting your site displays the site as it appears on your DreamHost server.</p>
