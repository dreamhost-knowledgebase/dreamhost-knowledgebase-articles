<p>On <strong>October 1, 2018</strong>, DreamHost will disable catch-all email address functionality for all new and existing domains. Shortly after this date, existing catch-all mailboxes and their messages will be deleted from DreamHost’s servers.</p>
<p>Catch-all forwards will also be disabled.</p>

<h2>What is a catch-all email address?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-all">catch-all</a> email address is a specialized mailbox on a domain that will “catch all” messages that were addressed to the domain, but do not match any specific email address or alias. A catch-all is optional for a domain, and there can be a maximum of one catch-all per domain.</p>
<p>Catch-alls are commonly used to recover incorrectly addressed messages that would otherwise bounce back to the sender.</p>
<p>However, since catch-alls offer 100% deliverability for all possible email addresses on a domain, they are a frequent target for spam, and often receive an overwhelming volume of junk messages. Also, legitimate senders who mistype an email address will receive no indication that their message has been routed to a catch-all, and that they may want to revise and resend their message to reach the intended recipient.</p>
<h2>How can I keep my catch-all email intact?</h2>
<p>You can retain any existing catch-all email messages by converting your existing catch-all address to a regular email address using the DreamHost panel.</p>
<p>To convert your catch-all email address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘MAIL’ &gt; ‘Manage Emails’</a>) page.
<dl>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Select the ‘catch-all’ email mailbox you wish to convert, and then click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>The Manage Email page opens, which shows you the existing ‘catch-all’ settings:</em></dd>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Make the following changes to the email settings for your existing catch-all address:
<ul>
<li><strong>Email Address</strong> — Replace the existing ‘catch-all’ address with a new address name.</li>
<li><strong>Mailbox Login</strong> — Do NOT make any changes to the Mailbox Login address. If you select ‘generate a new one’ from the drop-down list, a new empty mailbox will be created and your existing catch-all email will be deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Mailbox “Name”</strong> — <em>Optional</em>. Enter a new name for the mailbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you create a new address, your previous address will no longer function as a catch-all.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>Why is DreamHost removing catch-all addresses?</h3>
<p>Because they don’t reject any messages, domains with a catch-all attract an overwhelming volume of spam. This degrades performance of the mail system for all customers and delays delivery of legitimate messages.</p>
<p>Additionally, DreamHost’s <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214984738-Anti-spam-overview">Vade anti-spam servers</a> cannot be enabled on domains with an active catch-all address, so the large volume of spam messages sent to these domains cannot be filtered or blocked.</p>
<p>Finally, when a catch-all mailbox is forwarded to an external email address (either directly from the catch-all or through an intermediate account) DreamHost’s mail system gets falsely identified as a spammer by a number of global blacklists, negatively impacting the outbound deliverability of all customers’ email.</p>
<h3>Will this affect catch-all mailboxes or forwards?</h3>
<p>Yes. The entire catch-all functionality is being removed, so this impacts both mailboxes and forwards.</p>
<h3>How can I create an alias on my email address?</h3>
<p>DreamHost email accounts allow the use of ‘disposable’ or ‘on-the-fly’ email address aliases, where you can instantly generate a unique email address based on an existing mailbox.</p>
<p>These kinds of aliases are useful for tracking whether a particular website has shared or leaked your contact information, or for proactively categorizing email signups at various websites.</p>
<p>To create a new on-the-fly alias, add a plus symbol (+) followed by any combination of letters and digits after your email username, before the @. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Primary email</strong>: jim@example.com</dd>
<dd><strong>New alias</strong>: jim+somecoolshop22@example.com</dd>
<dd><strong>Another new alias</strong>: jim+onlinebanking@example.com</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mail sent to any of these addresses will deliver to jim@example.com.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the number of aliases you can create in this manner, and they require no setup ahead of time. This feature is already enabled on all DreamHost email accounts.</p>
