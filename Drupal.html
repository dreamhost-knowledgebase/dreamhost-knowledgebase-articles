<p><a class=" " href="http://www.drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">Drupal</a> is a full Content Management System (or CMS) that can be deployed with any number of purposes. It has been developed as an open-source project and released under the highly open GPL license. Drupal prides itself on being a system wherein the openness allows any developer to easily add functionality using modules, effectively creating an infinite platform for expansion and growth. Drupal is written in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214202188-PHP-overview">PHP</a> programming language.</p>

<h2><span id="Drupal_adoption_advice">Drupal adoption advice</span></h2>
<p>Drupal is a highly flexible and powerful tool, and as such should be used by those with knowledge of HTML, web applications, and at least a vague notion of how databases (such as <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215099117-MySQL-overview">MySQL</a>) function. You don't have to actually know PHP and MySQL to make it function, but a working knowledge of <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>, the web-based MySQL administration tool, is helpful, if not mandatory, for using Drupal.</p>
<p>If your goal is simply to maintain a blog (or weblog, something Drupal is quite capable of), you might consider using a simpler and more targeted application such as <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215525287-WordPress-overview">WordPress</a>, which is less confusing and more stable due to its simplicity.</p>

<li>Upload the files via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a> to your site’s web directory.</li>
<li>Create a MySQL database in your panel. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215099117-MySQL-overview">MySQL</a> article for instructions.</li>

<li>During the installation process, you’ll need to know your database credentials. You must also change the ‘Database host’ field from localhost to your actual DreamHost database hostname. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a> article for further details.</li>

<p>Changing the database port isn’t required. However, the DreamHost Database port is 3306. Then choose an appropriate table prefix if you feel inclined to do so.</p>

<p>It's recommended that you either deactivate account creation requests (in /admin/config/people/accounts) or install a spam-reducing module such as Mollom in order to stop spam user accounts right away. This requires more time and expertise.</p>

<p>If you are installing Drupal 7 with multiple modules, you may trigger an error message stating that the installation cannot find a needed table in the MySQL database. This usually means that the Drupal installation of the MySQL database on DreamHost has not finished populating the full list of tables with data. Give it some time and try the installation again. The length of time is dependent on the number of modules you have selected to install. If you are installing a fresh version of Drupal 7, you may have better results if you first install the slimmer version when the installation asks. You can always add more modules later.</p>

<p>Drupal 7 demands more resources, especially from the MySQL database. If you wish to use Drupal 7, you should seriously consider upgrading to a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">private MySQL server</a> which displays pages much more quickly.</p>
