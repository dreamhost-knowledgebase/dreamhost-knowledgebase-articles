<h2>How secure is my data?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Though DreamObjects doesn't support server-side encryption, it is secure since the only way to access its data is through an access and secret key (comparable to an FTP/shell username and password, but randomly generated by DreamHost). Additionally, you can employ client-side encryption by encrypting the data at your location and then using SSL to upload the data to DreamObjects.</p>
</div>
<p>DreamObjects is designed for 99.99999% durability over a given year. Using the latest in Cloud storage technology, your data is stored with additional parity bits throughout the DreamObject's data center ensuring further backup security.</p>
