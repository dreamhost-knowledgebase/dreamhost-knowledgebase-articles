<p>A new DreamPress installation should finish within thirty minutes or less. The following items <em>may</em> delay an installation:</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At this time, DreamHost has not banned customers from using any specific plugins. That said, there are some plugins that DreamHost does not recommend you use with DreamPress as they're not the best fit. In general, if a plugin uses PHP Sessions, it's not going to perform well with the built-in server cache and, thus, DreamPress.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a> — The way it sets cookies isn't 100% compatible with the DreamPress cache and can cause caching not to set.</li>
<li>Captcha plugins — These generally apply cookies and/or sessions in a way that tells the DreamPress cache not to cache. Try not to use them on comment pages.</li>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes. You can create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002837508-Creating-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain">temporary dream.press domain</a> to create your site on. Then when you're ready, Technical Support can switch it over to your actual domain name.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost recommends you only send emails from your WordPress site via an authenticated SMTP account to ensure reliable email delivery from your website. This includes SMTP accounts created at DreamHost or from a third-party email provider.</p>
<p>If your site is hosted on DreamPress, it only supports the WordPress installation and you cannot use any scripts or custom code to send outgoing emails (such as <span class="text-object">PHP mail()</span> or <span class="text-object">PHPMailer</span>).</p>
<p>DreamHost suggests using a plugin such as <span class="text-object">WP Mail SMTP</span> when configuring an SMTP account in order to send outgoing emails. This way, you ensure the emails are authenticated via SPF and DKIM, which helps you prevent spam classification.</p>
<p>See the following article that explains how to install and configure a plugin such as <span class="text-object">WP Mail SMTP</span>:</p>

<p>Only a single installation of WordPress is supported with DreamPress. No other applications are allowed. If you require other applications to be run under the same URL, a standard <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214879308-VPS-optimization-overview">VPS</a> plan is a better fit.</p>

<p>DreamPress offers three different plans depending on your hosting needs.

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The primary difference is the servers DreamPress is hosted on. With DreamPress, all WordPress sites are hosted on <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/categories/202115418-DreamCompute-Cloud-Servers">DreamCompute</a>, DreamHost's cloud service.</p>
<p>In addition, WordPress is automatically installed on every instance of DreamPress. On a Shared Hosting plan, WordPress can be installed through the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-Install-WordPress-using-the-DreamHost-WordPress-installer" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamHost WordPress install</a> feature located in the DreamHost control panel.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It depends on what you would like to do with your website. Here are a few comparisons between a VPS plan and DreamPress:</p>
<p><strong>Number of sites</strong> — On a VPS server, you can create as many WordPress installs as you like since you only pay for the server space. On a DreamPress server, you can only run a single site. You can add additional sites on DreamPress, but you pay for each new DreamPress site you add.&nbsp;Please keep in mind that you can have several sites on a DreamHost VPS while also having select sites on DreamPress, mixing and matching plans to fit your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Multisite</strong> — Multisite is not supported on DreamPress.</p>
<p><strong>Custom/Un-managed sites</strong>&nbsp;— DreamPress is a fully managed service which means it's easier for beginners and those that just want to focus on the website without worrying about the server at all. However, some websites are more specialized and require a dedicated tech person to make sure the server is running correctly. If your site is very customized, you may find a VPS is a better fit for your specific setup.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214897027-Enabling-ionCube-Loader">IonCube Loader</a> is not supported with DreamPress. IonCube's website states the following:</p>
<div class="text-blockquote">
<p>ionCube PHP Encoder is the industry standard solution for PHP software protection, making it straightforward and easy to protect PHP source code from observation, theft, and change.</p>
<p>The ionCube Encoder compiles source code to bytecode, can obfuscate and encrypt compiled code if desired and has features to protect decryption keys in various ways, including a unique approach of algorithmic non-stored keys we call <em>Dynamic Keys</em>.</p>

<p>Since the WordPress software is open source, there is never a reason to use IonCube Loader to hide your code.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes, but be careful. WordPress doesn't always play well with that, and the DreamPress cache won't know to flush the cache for that folder if it's <strong>not</strong> powered by WordPress. You may have to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215300647-How-do-I-purge-the-DreamPress-cache-">manually flush</a> the cache for that folder any time you update its contents.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes. You can use a secure connection on your site if you choose to. Bear in mind, while DreamHost caches all safe HTTPS&nbsp;requests, it still won't be quite as fast as a non-HTTPS site.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HD7PEWVRY06ZB600RBF42BEC"><span id="is_HTTP2_available">Is HTTP/2 available for DreamPress?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes! DreamPress servers come with HTTP/2 by default for SSL/TLS. It's included on all HTTPS sites (loaded automatically for all new users by default, all existing users with HTTPS, and all existing users who add HTTPS to their DreamPress domain.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HD7PEWVSPDXHBCSF72960GY7"><span id="how_much_traffic">How much traffic can my site take?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost does not limit the number of visitors to your site or have any overages for traffic. Many customers asked for a direct comparison of competitor offerings, so DreamHost took a look at the performance of DreamPress using loader.io, an independent benchmarking tool. This estimate is based on 50-100 un-cached visitors per minute (averaging 3 page views each) on a basic WordPress install filled with content. Under most circumstances, your site will be able to sustain significantly higher traffic levels due to DreamPress's multi-level caching systems.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HD7PEWVSCRTBTJAT5GXYZCA0"><span id="wordpress_caching_on_dreampress">How does WordPress caching work on DreamPress?</span></h2>
<p>DreamPress comes with <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/20105684094228-Managing-DreamPress-cache-with-the-Nginx-Helper-plugin">built-in server caching</a>, which creates a static version of your site. This helps your server to use fewer resources, allowing your site to load faster while managing larger amounts of traffic.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HD7PEWVS1TYPN8F5DXPV8TS0"><span id="can_i_use_other_plugins_besides_varnish">Can I use other plugins besides the DreamPress cache plugin for caching?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Many guides recommend caching plugins such as WP Super Cache on WordPress sites. However, since DreamPress comes with built-in caching, third-party caching plugins are not necessary and could even conflict with the built-in DreamPress cache.</p>
<p>You should, however, keep an updated version of the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/20105684094228-Managing-DreamPress-cache-with-the-Nginx-Helper-plugin">Nginx Helper plugin</a>, as it provides helpful tools to manage your DreamPress site's cache.</p>
