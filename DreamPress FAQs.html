<h3><span id="where_can_i_learn">Where can I learn about DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>This knowledge base offers several articles explaining how to use DreamPress. View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/categories/202198368-DreamPress">DreamPress category</a> for a list of articles.</p>
<h3><span id="how_long_does_it_take">How long does it take to set up DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>A new DreamPress installation should finish within thirty minutes or less. The following items <em>may</em> delay an installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are upgrading from an existing One-Click Install that has a lot of data that needs to be migrated.</li>
<li>if you're migrating an existing site without a DreamHost plan that has a significant amount of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to contact <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">support</a> for an update any time.</p>
<h3><span id="are_there_plugins_i_cant_use">Are there any plugins I can't use?</span></h3>
<p>At this time, DreamHost has not banned customers from using any specific plugins. That said, there are some plugins that DreamHost does not recommend you use with DreamPress as they're not the best fit. In general, if a plugin uses PHP Sessions, it's not going to perform well with Varnish and, thus, DreamPress.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bad-behavior/">Bad Behavior</a> — The way it sets cookies isn't 100% compatible with Varnish and can cause caching not to set.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-session-support/">Simple Session Support</a> — Uses PHP Sessions.</li>
<li>Captcha plugins — These generally apply cookies and/or sessions in a way that tells Varnish not to cache. Try not to use them on comment pages.</li>
<li>Advanced Custom Fields — This doesn't always play well with Memcached.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="develop_DP_site_hosted_elsewhere">Can I develop my site on DreamPress while it's hosted elsewhere?</span></h3>
<p>Yes. You can create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002837508-Creating-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain">temporary dream.press domain</a> to create your site on. Then when you're ready, Technical Support can switch it over to your actual domain name.</p>
<h2 class="header-section">Hosting</h2>
<h3><span id="what_can_i_host">What can I host on DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>The DreamPress service is only available and optimized for a single WordPress site. You can customize this single WordPress site however you like.</p>
<h3><span id="what_other_applications">What other applications can I host on DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>Only a single installation of WordPress is supported with DreamPress. No other applications are allowed. If you require other applications to be ran under the same URL, a standard <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214879308-VPS-optimization-overview">VPS</a> plan is a better fit.</p>
<h3><span id="how_many_sites">How many sites can I have on one DreamPress instance?</span></h3>
<p>DreamPress offers three different plans depending on your hosting needs. These plans allow you to host a single site, or multiple DreamPress sites. View the following article for further details on the different hosting options:</p>

<h2 class="header-section">Plans</h2>
<h3><span id="is_multisite_supported">Is Multisite/WPMU supported?</span></h3>
<p>Not at this time.</p>
<h3><span id="is_email_provided">Is email provided with DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>Yes. Email service is available on DreamPress-only accounts.</p>
<h3><span id="what_is_the_difference_DP_and_shared">What is the difference between using DreamPress and Shared hosting?</span></h3>
<p>The primary difference are the servers DreamPress is hosted on. With DreamPress, all WordPress sites are hosted on <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/categories/202115418-DreamCompute-Cloud-Servers">DreamCompute</a>, DreamHost's cloud service.</p>
<p>In addition, WordPress is automatically installed on every instance of DreamPress. On a shared hosting plan, WordPress can be installed through the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215915837-How-do-I-install-a-One-Click-Install-">One-Click Install</a> feature located in the DreamHost control panel.</p>
<h3><span id="is_there_only_one_plan">Is there only one DreamPress plan?</span></h3>
<p>No, there are three. View the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215298557-DreamPress-plans-and-pricing">DreamPress plans and pricing</a>' article for further details.</p>
<h3><span id="dreampress_instead_of_wp_on_vps">Why should I purchase DreamPress instead of running WordPress on a VPS?</span></h3>
<p>It depends on what you would like to do with your website. Here are a few reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Number of sites</strong> — On a VPS server, you can create as many WordPress installs as you like since you only pay for the server space. On a DreamPress server, you can only run a single site. You can add additional sites on an 'Advanced' plan, but you pay for each new DreamPress site you add.</p>
<p><strong>Multisite</strong> — Multisite is not supported on DreamPress.</p>
<p><strong>Custom/Un-managed sites</strong> — DreamPress is a fully managed service which means it's easier for beginners and those that just want to focus on the website without worrying about the server at all. However, some websites are more specialized and require a dedicated tech person to make sure the server is running correctly. If your site is very customized, you may find a VPS is a better fit for your specific setup.</p>
<h2 class="header-section">Customizations</h2>
<h3><span id="can_i_create_cronjobs">Can I create cronjobs with my DreamPress user?</span></h3>
<p>By default, DreamPress users are created as SFTP users so support for cronjobs is not immediately available. See the following article for further instructions on how to change the user type:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Enabling-Shell-access">Enabling Shell Access</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="can_i_use_ioncube_loader">Can I use IonCube Loader with DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214897027-Enabling-ionCube-Loader">IonCube Loader</a> is not supported with DreamPress. IonCube's website states that it's purpose is to "makes it easy to protect PHP source code from easy observation, theft and change by compiling to bytecode." Since the WordPress software is open source, there is never a reason to use IonCube Loader to hide your code.</p>
<p>If you absolutely require IonCube, the only options are to downgrade to a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared</a> hosting plan.</p>
<h3><span id="alter_PHP_configuration">Can I alter my PHP configuration for a DreamPress site?</span></h3>
<p>You can find instructions on how to edit your php.ini in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">PHP.ini</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-section">Security</h2>
<h3><span id="will_i_have_root_access">Will I have root/sudo access on a DreamPress plan?</span></h3>
<p>No. Only on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> plan is root/sudo access available.</p>
<h3><span id="how_do_i_use_SSL">How do I use SSL on DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>All DreamPress sites come configured with a free '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216539558-Let-s-Encrypt-SSL-certificate-overview">Let's Encrypt</a>' SSL certificate. It's installed along with DreamPress so you do not need to configure it manually.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Adding an SSL certificate will redirect all DreamPress generated links. However, it's possible for a visitor to input a direct URL to your site which is not encrypted. To force ALL requests (even direct HTTP requests) to redirect to HTTPS, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215747758#Forcing_HTTPS_with_DreamPress">add this code to your .htaccess file</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span id="can_i_password_protect_folders">Can I have password protected folders?</span></h3>
<p>Yes, but be careful. WordPress doesn't always play well with that, and Varnish won't know to flush the cache for that folder if it's <strong>not</strong> powered by WordPress. You may have to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215300647-How-do-I-purge-the-DreamPress-cache-">manually flush</a> the cache for that folder any time you update its contents.</p>
<h3><span id="is_HTTPS_supported">Is Secure Hosting (HTTPS) supported by DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>Yes. You can use a secure connection on your site if you choose to. Bear in mind, while DreamHost caches all safe HTTPS requests, it still won't be quite as fast as a non-HTTPS site.</p>
<h3><span id="is_HTTP2_available">Is HTTP/2 available for DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>Yes! DreamPress servers come with Nginx and HTTP/2 by default for SSL/TLS. It's included on all HTTPS sites (loaded automatically for all new users by default, all existing users with HTTPS, and all existing users who add HTTPS to their DreamPress domain.</p>
<h2 class="header-section">Traffic</h2>
<h3><span id="how_can_i_increase_traffic">How can I increase traffic to my site?</span></h3>
<p>DreamHost offers the following ebook with information on how to attract more visitors to your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dh-docs.objects-us-east-1.dream.io/driving-traffic-to-site.pdf">Driving traffic to your DreamPress site</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="how_much_traffic">How much traffic can my site take?</span></h3>
<p>DreamHost does not limit the amount of visitors to your site, or have any overages for traffic. Many customers asked for a direct comparison of competitor offerings, so DreamHost took a look at the performance of DreamPress using loader.io, an independent benchmarking tool. This estimate is based on 50-100 un-cached visitors per minute (averaging 3 page views each) on a basic WordPress install filled with content. Under most circumstances, your site will be able to sustain significantly higher traffic levels due to DreamPress's multi-level caching systems.</p>
<h2 class="header-section">Caching</h2>
<h3><span id="wordpress_caching_on_dreampress">How does WordPress caching work on DreamPress?</span></h3>
<p>Your DreamPress install comes with a plugin called "<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/varnish-http-purge">Varnish HTTP Purge</a>", written by DreamHost WordPress developers. When active, the plugin automatically detects changes to your post content (be it an edit, a new post, or a comment on a post) and will flush the appropriate cache for you. The plugin runs on its own and requires no configuration for the majority of users.</p>
<p>If you edit content outside of WordPress such as uploading media via SFTP or editing CSS directly, you need to use the "<strong>Purge</strong>" button in your WordPress Toolbar.</p>
<h3><span id="how_can_i_ensure_site_is_cached">How can I be sure my site is cached?</span></h3>
<p>Since logged in users (that is, you) don't get the same cached page, this can be hard to figure out if you're not accustomed to looking at page headers. A useful tool is <a href="https://isvarnishworking.uk/">https://isvarnishworking.uk/</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="can_i_use_cloudflare_and_varnish">Can I use Cloudflare and Varnish together?</span></h3>
<p>When you use Cloudflare or any other similar service, there's a proxy in front of the Varnish proxy. In general, this isn't a bad thing. The problem arises when the DNS sends the purge request to your domain name. When you have an additional proxy like Cloudflare, you don't want the request to go to the proxy; you want it to go instead to the Varnish server.</p>
<p>To fix this, add the following to your wp-config.php file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('VHP_VARNISH_IP','123.45.67.89');</pre>
</div>
<p>Replace "123.45.67.89" with the IP of your Varnish Server (not Cloudflare, Varnish). DO NOT put in http in this define statement.</p>
<p>You can also set the option vhp_varnish_ip in the database. This will NOT take precedence over the define; it's just there to let hosts who are using something like wp-cli do this for you in an automated fashion:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">wp option add vhp_varnish_ip 123.45.67.89</span></pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><em>and</em></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">wp option update vhp_varnish_ip 123.45.67.890</span></pre>
</div>
<p>To find your Varnish IP, go to (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) and click on the <strong>DNS</strong> link beneath the domain. The IP address entry for the www or blank A record is your varnish server. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">www A 208.97.157.172</pre>
</div>
<h3><span id="can_i_use_other_plugins_besides_varnish">Can I use other plugins besides your Varnish plugin for caching?</span></h3>
<p>Yes, but DreamHost does not provide support for them. It's possible to set up W3 Total Cache, for example, to use Varnish. You may need to enter your Varnish IP address. To find that, go to (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) and click on the <strong>DNS</strong> link beneath the domain. The IP Address entry for <em>www</em> is your varnish server. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">www A 208.97.157.172</pre>
</div>
