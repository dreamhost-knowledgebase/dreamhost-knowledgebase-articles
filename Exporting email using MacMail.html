<p>This article explains how to export (download/backup) your email using MacMail 11.5 to your computer.</p>
<h2>Exporting your email</h2>
<p>You'll need to connect your address to the mail server you wish to download email from.</p>
<p>This means that if you're backing up email from your old hosting company, you'll need to use their email settings to connect to their mail servers.</p>
<p>If you're connecting to a DreamHost address, use the following article instead:</p>
