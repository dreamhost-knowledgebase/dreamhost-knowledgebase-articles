<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article describes how to copy your primary DreamPress site to a staging website. The staging site allows you to test changes you plan on making on your live site while your live site remains up and running normally.</p>
<p>When you're finished working on your staging site and have it configured the way you like, you can then <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003444252-Publishing-your-changes-from-Staging-to-your-live-DreamPress-site" target="_self">publish those changes back into your live website</a>.</p>

<p>If your site has been previously hacked and then used DreamHost's <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/226704048-How-do-I-enable-DreamShield-" target="_self">DreamShield</a> service, you must clean up the files that were hacked/disabled before you are able to enable staging on your site.</p>

<ul>
<li>DreamPress Staging uses Git to copy files. If you have your own active Git repository in one of your live site's folders, the folder's contents will not be copied to your staging site. To use staging successfully, you can manually copy the contents of the folder using SFTP or SSH. DreamPress recommends as a best practice to manage your Git repository in a separate development environment instead of your live site.</li>
<li>When you enable staging for the first time, your DreamPress plan must have at least 5 GB of free space.</li>
<li>The Uploads folder is not copied to your staging site, in order to use disk space efficiently. Replacing an existing image in your Media Library will modify it for the live site.</li>
</ul>
