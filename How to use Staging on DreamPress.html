<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Staging gives you the freedom and conﬁdence to test changes before you publish without worry. It creates a copy of your site in a "sandbox" environment where you can experiment and preview changes without it affecting what your visitors see. When you're ready, push your changes to your live site with a simple click.</p>

<h2>Best practices</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Password protecting your staging site</h3>
<p>Search engines will penalize your site for duplicate content. To avoid this, your staging site is automatically password protected so it does not lose SEO ranking.</p>
<h3>Transferring changes to your live site</h3>
<p>Be careful when you copy from your staging site to your live site: you could potentially lose/overwrite any changes on your live site you've made since you started working on the staging site.</p>
<p>If you do choose to copy from the staging site, make sure to backup your live site just to be safe.</p>
