<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>DreamCompute offers multiple clusters (also often called availability zones) which are independent OpenStack installations with their own servers, storage, and control panel. Some clusters have different features, such as SSD storage or different hardware that is useful for a given task. Migrating instances and data between clusters is not automated at this time, and this guide shows you how to accomplish this yourself.</p>
<p>This guide assumes that you are comfortable working with SSH, and some command line utilities such as <a class="reference external" href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html">dd</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-openstackclient/man/openstack.html">openstack</a>.</p>

<div id="things-to-keep-in-mind">
<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind and plan while doing a migration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>IP addresses will change</strong></p>
<p>Each cluster has assigned blocks of IP addresses, and therefore floating IPs, public IPv4, and public IPv6 addresses cannot be transferred between clusters. If you are using private networks (required in US-East 1 and optional in US-East 2), the specific assigned 10.x.x.x address may also change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>SSH keys</strong></p>
<p>Each cluster manages its SSH Keys separately, so if you have your keys already set up in US-East 1, you must set up the same keys or new ones in US-East 2. If OpenStack generated the SSH Key for you, it lets you download the private key but the public key is what you would need for an import. You could grab it from the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on an instance that used the key. For the instances themselves, the authorized_keys file is only appended to, not overwritten, so whatever keys are currently set up continue to work after the move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Plan a maintenance window</strong></p>
<p>To avoid open files causing corruption or other odd behavior, it is safest to move the data when the instance is not running. The copying of the data is generally pretty quick for smaller volumes, but for larger volumes it could take some time. Remember, the copy must complete before service can be restored. Also, DNS must be updated from the old public IPs to the new ones. Depending on the time to live (TTL) of your DNS provider, this process can take a matter of minutes, or 24 hours. DNS zones managed by DreamHost can have the TTL changed from 4 hours to 5 minutes if you contact support at least 24 hours in advance of your changes. This can help minimize propagation time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Ephemeral instances</strong></p>
<p>Ephemeral instances cannot be used as the source of a snapshot and cannot have its data accessed by another instance when shut off. These instances can only be migrated while running, so it is best to shut down as many services as possible (such as MySQL, Apache, and so on) to limit the possibility of corruption. Please see the last section below for <a class="reference external" href="218501427#migrate-an-ephemeral-instance-using-the-openstack-cli">instructions on migrating running instances</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="migrating-a-volume-backed-instance-using-the-openstack-cli">
<h2>Migrating a volume-backed instance using the OpenStack CLI</h2>
<p>For this type of move, it is necessary to delete the instance so that it leaves behind the volume to migrate. This method requires that you did not check the ‘delete on terminate’ box when you created your instance. If you did, please skip to the last section for <a class="reference external" href="218501427#migrate-an-ephemeral-instance-using-the-openstack-cli">instructions on migrating running instances</a>. If you continue, you may permanently destroy and lose your data.</p>
<p>As an overview, here are the components involved in accomplishing this task:</p>

<p>Follow this procedure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a new instance using the smallest available flavor which is used as a copy machine. This guide uses Ubuntu 14.04, but the commands should be similar on any Ubuntu system. It is also recommended that you make the instance ephemeral, since it will not be needed after the migration is complete.</li>
<li>Install the needed software to access the glance image service on this new instance:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight-console">

</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Set up your OpenStack RC file for the DESTINATION cluster on this new instance, which can be downloaded from its Access &amp; Security -&gt; API Access menu in the dashboard. Either upload the file to your instance or copy/paste its contents into a file on this instance. Once you finish, run the following:</li>

<li>Delete the instance that you wish to move, freeing up its volume to be attached to the above newly-created instance.</li>
<li>To attach the volume to the new instance, go to the Volumes menu, click on the drop-down box in the ‘Actions’ column on the right side, and then click ‘Edit Attachments’.</li>
<li>On the new instance, check “dmesg” for the drive letter of the new volume. You can also check the usual names for it. The following is an example which should match the size of the volume you are trying to move. Make note of the drive letter (the /dev/vdX part):</li>

</div>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>Use dd to pipe the data directly into the glance image service. Don’t forget to change the drive letter in the example below to the one you found above. You can also change any text in all CAPS to suit your taste.</li>
