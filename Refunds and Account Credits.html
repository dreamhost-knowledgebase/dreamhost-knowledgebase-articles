<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Not all payments are automatically refunded when you cancel DreamHost hosting services. This article discusses when refunds are automatically issued and what payment methods can be refunded.</p>
</div>
<h3><span id="If_I_cancel_hosting_services.2C_will_I_receive_a_refund_automatically.3F">If I cancel a hosting plan, will I receive a refund automatically?</span></h3>
<p>No. However, if you decide to cancel a service plan while keeping the account active, DreamHost may provide a prorated credit for any remaining time on the canceled hosting plan, which you can apply to other DreamHost services. Please see the <span class="text-section">Credits by hosting plan</span> section below for more information.</p>
<h3>When will I receive a refund?</h3>
<p>Refunds are only issued after an account is closed, the credit is confirmed to be refundable, and the last payment method is confirmed to be active. When these conditions are met, the refund is then processed and can take up to 30 days to complete (depending on the type of payment method). For example, credit card refunds typically take 5â€“7 business days to reflect back to the customer's credit card account; if the refund is processed via a manual check, it may take up to 30 days for the check to be mailed out.</p>
<p>Any other credit will remain on the account after closure.</p>
<h3>What account credits are refundable?</h3>
<p>Refundable account credits are generally only issued under DreamHost's 97-day guarantee or within 30 days of purchasing or renewing a yearly service plan.</p>
<h3>What will happen if I change from a Yearly plan to a Monthly plan?</h3>
<p>If you change your billing plan from Yearly to Monthly, an account credit will be provided for the remaining unused balance.</p>
<h3>If I close my account with unused account credit, how will I be refunded?</h3>
<p>A refund is automatically processed back to the original credit card that was used towards the fees, only after you close your account in your panel.</p>
<p>Payments made via check/money order cannot be refunded once cleared.</p>

<h2><span id="Are_all_payment_methods_refundable.3F">Are all payment methods refundable?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Unfortunately, DreamHost does not offer automatic refunds for the following payment methods:</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>A 3% transaction fee is applied If you select PayPal to process a refund, which is only applied if the payment was not originally processed via PayPal.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Check (written checks or electronic checks)</li>
<li>Money Orders</li>
<li>Gift Certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>If you close your Shared Hosting plan within 97 days of opening the account and had made a manual payment toward the plan with one of these other methods, then&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Support</a> for further assistance with your refund.</p>
<p>If your account is closed after the 97 day refund period has passed,&nbsp;no refunds are issued. View the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;page for further details.</p>
</div>
<h2>Domain registrations</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Are domain registrations refundable?</h3>
<p>No. Registrations are owned by you for the full term you originally purchased them for. This is usually a 1- to 3-year time period.</p>
<p>If your registration includes a free domain with your Shared Hosting plan and you canceled the plan in the first year, you are then required to pay for the free registration. View the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528#paying-for-registration-after-canceling" target="_self">Why do I have to pay for my free domain registration when closing my account?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Can I still use my domain registration?</h3>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;If at some point you would like to have your domain point to a different web host, you will be able to log in to the&nbsp;<a href="http://panel.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost panel</a>&nbsp;and make your changes to your&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS settings</a>&nbsp;to point to the new host.</p>
<h3 class="subheader"><span id="domreg_renewal_refunds">Are domain registration renewals or transfers refundable?</span></h3>
<p>No. Once a domain is transferred, auto-renewed, or is manually renewed, your credit card is charged and the domain is renewed for one more year.</p>
<p>At this point, the domain registry updates its information to show that you are the owner for an additional year. Since there's no way to reverse the renewal from the registry, a refund is not possible.</p>
