<p>When connecting to your DreamObjects bucket using a client or script, you should use the following URL:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="command">objects-us-east-1.dream.io</span></pre>
</div>
<p>This assumes your bucket is in the EAST coast data center. View the following article to determine where your bucket is currently hosted:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002135871#what-cluster-is-my-data-on">What cluster is my DreamObjects data currently on?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If your bucket is still on the old WEST cluster, make sure you migrate your data to the new EAST cluster by Oct 1st 2018.</p>

<h2>Old hostname</h2>
<p>Older DreamObjects buckets may still be on the old WEST coast cluster using the old hostname of <span class="code">objects-us-west-1.dream.io</span>. This will be deactivated on Oct 1st 2018, so it's highly recommended you migrate your data to the EAST cluster before this date.</p>
