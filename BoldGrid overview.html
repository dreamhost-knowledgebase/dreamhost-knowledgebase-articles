<p>Use these instructions if you need to deactivate the BoldGrid Inspirations website builder plugin:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360001310966-How-to-log-into-your-WordPress-site">wp-admin</a> page for your WordPress site.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/wp-admin-deactivate-boldgrid-2020.png" alt="wp-admin-deactivate-boldgrid-2020.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li>Click the <span class="text-link">Deactivate</span> link under the&nbsp;<span class="text-object">BoldGrid Inspirations</span> plugin.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Things to consider when deactivating BoldGrid</h3>
<p>The BoldGrid Inspiration plugin controls many of the design features in WordPress, and your website may look quite different once it's deactivated.</p>
<p>When you deactivate the BoldGrid Inspirations plugin, your theme will switch to the standard WordPress theme, Twenty Twenty. All of your posts, pages, and images (if any) will still remain intact. You can also re-activate BoldGrid, delete it entirely, or select a new theme if needed.</p>
<p>In addition to BoldGrid Inspirations, there are several other plugins that you may also wish to deactivate, such as <span class="text-object">BoldGrid Gallery</span> and <span class="text-object">BoldGrid Post and Page Builder</span> (to name a few). You can use the same instructions described in the previous section to deactivate these plugins as well.</p>
