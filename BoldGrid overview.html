<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>BoldGrid (aka, 'WP Website Builder') is a simple-to-use WordPress site builder. It uses a drag &amp; drop editor, which allows you to quickly build and customize a professional website without the need for coding.</p>
<p>BoldGrid comes pre-configured with a list of mobile-friendly themes for you to choose from depending on your site's needs. Additional tools such as backups are available as well to ensure your data is safe.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="header-section">Enabling BoldGrid on your website</h2>
<p>There are three options to enable BoldGrid on your WordPress website.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Option 1&nbsp;—&nbsp;Sign up for BoldGrid when opening a DreamHost account</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<h2>Option 2 —&nbsp;Enable BoldGrid on an existing WordPress installation</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you didn't originally install BoldGrid when setting up your DreamHost WordPress plan, you can still enable it within the panel.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p><strong>Disable other editors</strong></p>
<p>BoldGrid should not be used if another website builder, such as Elementor, is already in use. If your site was built using one WordPress website builder and you want to change to another, you should first use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003838631-Creating-a-staging-WordPress-site" target="_self">staging site</a> instead of installing both builders on the live site.</p>
