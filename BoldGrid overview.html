<h2>How can I enable BoldGrid on a WordPress installation?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you didn't originally sign up for BoldGrid on your DreamHost WordPress plan, you can still enable it two different ways through your web panel.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>After enabling BoldGrid using one of the methods below, a BoldGrid Premium Connect Key is installed.</p>
<p>To confirm if a Premium Connect Key was installed, from your WordPress dashboard click the <span class="text-object">Dashboard</span> tab in the left pane. On the right side under <span class="text-section">BoldGrid Notifications</span>, look for <span class="text-section">Boldgrid Connect Key</span>. If a key is not installed, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact DreamHost support</a>.</p>

<h3>Existing WordPress installations</h3>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>BoldGrid should not be used if another website builder, such as Elementor, is already in use. If your site was built using one WordPress website builder and you want to change to another, you should first use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003838631-Creating-a-staging-WordPress-site" target="_self">staging site</a> instead of installing both builders on the live site.</p>
