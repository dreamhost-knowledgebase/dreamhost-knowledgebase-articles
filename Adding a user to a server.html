<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To add a new website user:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Users</a> page in your panel.
<dl>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Username</strong> — A username for the new user.</li>
<li><strong>Nickname</strong> — A nickname for the new user.</li>
<li><strong>What server will this user have access to?</strong> — Click the down arrow and select the Shared server on which the user will have access.</li>
<li><strong>Secure shell access</strong> — Use the toggle button to enable Secure Shell/SSH (right) or disable (left). If 'Secure shell access' is disabled, then SFTP is used.</li>
<li><strong>Select the Shell Type</strong> — If Secure shell access is enabled, then the 'Select the Shell Type' drop-down box appears. You can select bash, tcsh, ksh, or zsh. See the <a class="reference internal" href="#Shell_users">Shell users</a> section below for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When finished, click the <strong>Create User</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Difference between SFTP and Shell users</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>New users are created as SFTP or Shell users. The following explains the difference between these user types.</p>
<h3><span id="SFTP_users">SFTP users</span></h3>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>FTP is not considered a secure protocol since all of your traffic (including your login information) is transferred over the Internet in plain text, where anyone could eavesdrop. For more information, see <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security" target="_self">FTP Security</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason, DreamHost strongly recommends you only use an SFTP or Shell user. If you need to use FTP for any reason, see the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#Creating_an_SFTP_user_when_editing_domain">FTP overview</a> article for instructions on how to change the protocol to FTP.</p>
</div>
</div>
An SFTP user is required in order to upload a website you've created to DreamHost's servers, or to make changes to an existing website.
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a> users are similar to FTP users except that the SFTP protocol uses an encrypted connection to access a server. Port 22 is used in your client to connect to the server via SFTP.</p>
<p>The <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard" target="_self">Manage Users</a> page shows the username and the type of user it’s configured as.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage_users_show-info.png" alt="manage users show info button" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>In the following example, the username is 'dh_test_user'. Click the <strong>Show Info </strong>button&nbsp;to display details about this user.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage-users-edit-access-settings.png" alt="manage users edit access settings" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here you can see the user is set as an SFTP user.</p>
<h3><span id="Shell_users">Shell users</span></h3>
<p>Shell users are users who can connect via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>, and (optionally) FTP. The "<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access" target="_self">Shell</a>" is the Linux command line on your hosting server, a useful alternative for advanced users.</p>
<p><strong>Changing to a Shell user</strong></p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage_users_show-info.png" alt="manage users show info button" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>From the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard" target="_self">Manage Users</a> page, click the <strong>Show Info</strong> link next to your user.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage-users-edit-access-settings.png" alt="manage users edit access settings" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here you can see the user is set as an SFTP user. You can change the user to a Shell user so it has SSH access by&nbsp;clicking the 'Edit Access Settings' link.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage-users-change-to-ssh.png" alt="manage users select ssh" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>From the dropdown, select SSH.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage-users-shell-types.png" alt="manage users select ssh" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Select the type of Shell you wish to use. Bash is the default Shell type. Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access">creating a Shell user</a>, you are also given 4 shell options for the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216557548-Available-shells-at-DreamHost">Bash</a> – stands for Bourne-again shell, and is the default shell on Linux and Mac OS based systems.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216557548-Available-shells-at-DreamHost">Tcsh</a> – is an enhanced version of the Berkeley UNIX C shell. It is a command language interpreter that can be used as an interactive login shell and a shell script command processor.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216557548-Available-shells-at-DreamHost">Ksh</a> – also know as KornShell, and is an interactive command line language that can provide access to the UNIX system as well as other systems on which it’s implemented.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216557548-Available-shells-at-DreamHost">Zsh</a> – a shell made for interactive use and is also a scripting language.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the following article for more information about using available shells at DreamHost:</p>

</ul>
<h3>What if I own more than one website at DreamHost?</h3>
<p>Every website hosted with DreamHost is "owned" by exactly one user. However, a single user may own more than one website. In that case, each site would have its own directory under the user's root directory.</p>
<p>You can configure the account so that a user only has access to one subdirectory on a DreamHost website.</p>
<h3><span id="Why_does_it_say_my_name_is_already_taken.3F">Why does it say my name is already taken?</span></h3>
<p>On shared web hosting accounts, the "namespace" for usernames is shared across a fairly large cluster of machines. As a result, all the usernames created for FTP/SFTP/SHELL users must be unique across the whole group. Typically, common user names such as “admin” have already been taken so users may need to add extra characters to their user to ensure it is unique.</p>
