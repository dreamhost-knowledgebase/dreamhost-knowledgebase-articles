<ul>
<li>
<strong>Username</strong> — A username for the new user.</li>
<li>
<strong>Server</strong> — Click the down arrow and select the server on which the user will have access.</li>
<li>

<h2>What if I own more than one website at DreamHost?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every website hosted with DreamHost is "owned" by exactly one user. However, a single user may own more than one website. In that case, each site would have its own directory under the user's root directory.</p>
<p>You can configure the account so that a user only has access to one subdirectory on a DreamHost website.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Why_does_it_say_my_name_is_already_taken.3F">Why does it say my name is already taken?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The "namespace" for DreamHost usernames is shared across a fairly large cluster of machines. As a result, all the usernames created for FTP/SFTP/SHELL users must be unique across the whole group. Typically, common user names such as “admin” have already been taken so users may need to add extra characters to their user to ensure it is unique.</p>
