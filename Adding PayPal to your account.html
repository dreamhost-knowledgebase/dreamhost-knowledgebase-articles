<h2>Setting up PayPal</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you use an eCheck or ACH to deposit funds into your PayPal account (instead of a credit card), PayPal holds the eCheck/ACH payment until the check actually clears, before it can be allocated for payment. This can take time, depending on the bank and its policies. Make sure to check your receipt from PayPal to confirm when the funds are posted and are available to make a payment.</p>
</div>
<p>You can set up and link your PayPal service to make AutoPay and single payments on your DreamHost account.</p>
<h3>Enabling AutoPay on your PayPal account</h3>
<p>The advantage of setting up AutoPay is that DreamHost will automatically charge your card whenever a payment is due, which saves you time and hassle in paying for recurring charges every month.</p>
<p>To set up Paypal for Autopay:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.payment&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Payments</a> page.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <span class="text-section">Setup AutoPay</span> section.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>PayPal</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>When you select PayPal, the PayPal login screen opens.&nbsp;If you're already logged in and wish to use a different account instead, click the <span class="text-link">Not you?</span> link and enter your PayPal email address and password.</p>
<p>After you log in, authorize the payment. You'll then return to the <span class="hl-panel-page">Manage Payments</span> page to confirm the AutoPay purchase.</p>
</div>
