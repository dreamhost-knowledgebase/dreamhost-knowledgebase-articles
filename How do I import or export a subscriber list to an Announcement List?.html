<li>Create a new list, or click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of an existing list.</li>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>All subscribers to all announcement lists must confirm their intention to subscribe. So, when you paste in this list, you'll first be emailing all of them a message (which you can customize) explaining that you've moved your list provider and will need everybody who wants to keep receiving the list to re-confirm their subscription. Then, they'll only need to click a link in that email in order to do so.</p>

<h2>Exporting a list of subscribers</h2>
<p>The only way to do this is to cut and paste the subscribers in your panel into a text editor, and then save the file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.list&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Announcement List’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of an existing list.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the 'Current subscriber list' section.

<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/07_Announcement_list.png" alt="07 Announcement list.png" width="799" height="245" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Select which information you'd like displayed for each user.</li>
<li>Copy all information in the text field to a text editor such as <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll then have a list in a plain text file of all of your email subscribers.</p>
