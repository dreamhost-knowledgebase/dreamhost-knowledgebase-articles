<p>A standard DNS subdomain record has a corresponding name such as blog.example.com. However, sometimes it may be necessary to enable Wildcard DNS which does not have a single record assigned. Instead of appearing as blog.example.com (or any other subdomain), it appears as *.example.com. The * character is used to match non-existing subdomain names.</p>
<p>Simply put, Wildcard DNS is used to provide DNS records for subdomains that do not exist.</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_I_use_a_Wildcard_DNS_at_DreamHost.3F">How can I use a Wildcard DNS at DreamHost?</span></h2>
<p>You can implement Wildcard DNS for domains that are running <em>only</em> on DreamHost’s <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">Virtual Private Server</a> plan. This is due to the extremely high resource usage (and potential abuse) that usually comes with installing software that relies on Wildcard DNS in order to function (i.e., WordPress Multi-User, or WPMU, and others).</p>
<p>DreamHost may, in special cases, set this up for a customer. This is a manual procedure for the support staff so please make sure that it's something that you absolutely need and that the domain in question is currently running on a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> before requesting it. Please also make sure that you're aware of the <a href="http://www.iab.org/documents/docs/2003-09-20-dns-wildcards.html">technical implications</a> of having a wildcard DNS entry set up on your domain.</p>
