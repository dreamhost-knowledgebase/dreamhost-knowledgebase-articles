<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A standard DNS subdomain record has a corresponding name such as <strong>blog.example.com</strong>. However, sometimes it may be necessary to enable Wildcard DNS which does not have a single record assigned. Instead of appearing as <strong>blog.example.com</strong> (or any other subdomain), it appears as <strong>*.example.com</strong>. The * character is used to match non-existing subdomain names.</p>
<p>Simply put, Wildcard DNS is used to provide DNS records for subdomains that do not exist.</p>

<p>Wildcard DNS is separate from Wildcard SSL certificates. It's currently not possible to use a Wildcard SSL certificate at DreamHost. View the following article for further details.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can implement Wildcard DNS for domains that are running <em>only</em> on DreamHostâ€™s <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">Virtual Private Server</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> plan. This is due to the extremely high resource usage (and potential abuse) that usually comes with installing software that relies on Wildcard DNS in order to function (i.e., WordPress Multi-User, or WPMU, and others).</p>
<p>DreamHost may, in special cases, set this up for a customer. This is a manual procedure for the support staff so please make sure that it's something that you absolutely need and that the domain in question is currently running on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> server before requesting it. Please also make sure that you're aware of the <a href="https://www.iab.org/documents/correspondence-reports-documents/docs2003/2003-09-20-dns-wildcards/">technical implications</a> of having a wildcard DNS entry set up on your domain.</p>

<h2>Unmanaged option using DreamCompute</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The above configurations only apply to VPS and Dedicated servers which are managed by DreamHost. You also have the option of creating a cloud server using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/234961387-Getting-started-with-DreamCompute">DreamCompute</a>, DreamHost's cloud computing service.</p>
<p>When you create a DreamCompute instance, you have full control over the server meaning you are able to install anything you like on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003441752-Adding-a-website-to-DreamCompute">point your website to your DreamCompute instance</a>, you can then add a wildcard DNS entry in your DreamHost panel. Any additional configurations must be done by logging into your DreamCompute instance.</p>
<p>However, please note that technical support is unable to assist in any way with customizations made to a cloud server. If you choose to use this option, you must be ready to install all software and troubleshoot any issues that may arise from it.</p>
