<p>MX records control where emails for your domain are routed and sent for delivery. Be sure that the email addresses you want to receive mail at are properly set up and working before changing the MX records to direct mail to the new location. If you change the MX records before setting up those mail accounts, or make an error when changing the MX records, emails sent to you may bounce back to the sender or be lost.</p>
<p>To change your MX records domain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Custom MX’</a>) page.</li>
<li>To the right of your domain, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several options that appear on the Custom MX page which are described below.</p>
