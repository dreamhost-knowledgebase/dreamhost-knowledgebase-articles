<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>MX records control where emails for your domain are routed and sent for delivery. Be sure that the email addresses you want to receive mail at are properly set up and working before changing the MX records to direct mail to the new location. If you change the MX records before setting up those mail accounts, or make an error when changing the MX records, emails sent to you may bounce back to the sender or be lost.</p>
<p>To change your MX records domain:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Custom MX</a> page.</li>
<li>To the right of your domain, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several options that appear on the Custom MX page which are described below.</p>

</dl>
<p>Regular DreamHost email is set by default, and all the MX and other mail DNS records are automatically created to send your emails to DreamHost's servers.</p>
<p>You can use the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> page to configure your domain's email addresses, both fully-hosted and forward-only.</p>

</dl>
<p>If you’ve previously hosted your email outside of DreamHost and wish to now host email with DreamHost, you’ll see a button titled <strong>Make me regular now!</strong> which you can click to change your MX records back to DreamHost.</p>

<p>If you'd like to host your email at a different company, you can enter that company's MX records at the bottom of this page. This will redirect all new email to the new email hosting company.</p>
<p>Use this if your mail service is hosted by a different provider and you want emails delivered to your mail accounts there.</p>
<h3>Example of Google's MX records</h3>
<p>When setting up your domain with G Suite, Google's panel will guide you through the configuration of your MX records. Within the G Suite panel, these MX records will display:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_google_gsuite_mx_records.png" alt="Google mx records" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You must enter these records into your DreamHost panel as shown below. Make sure to enter the priority before the record name.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_google_mx_records.png" alt="Google mx records" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Once saved, it will take about 6hrs to update online. Your email will then be hosted with Google.</p>
<h3>Do I need to enter the dot at the end of the record?</h3>
<p>No. The DreamHost system will add this automatically.</p>
<h3>How do I locate my new provider's DNS records?</h3>
<p>Your new mail provider will give you the MX records you need to enter on this page. They may also give you Custom A or Custom CNAME records to add as well, but those must be added on the 'Manage Domains' page as 'Custom DNS' records. View the following article for instructions on how to add those (if necessary):</p>

</ul>
<h3>Other considerations</h3>
<p>Any DreamHost-hosted mail accounts you currently use will remain active, but existing old emails may not be saved. You can download them in your panel by running a full account backup.</p>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> page will no longer display or let you configure the old addresses.</p>
<p>Leave the "...still check my email..." option un-checked to ensure emails are properly delivered to your custom MX records server.</p>
<p>To use custom MX records with an external spam filtering service that sends all emails back to DreamHost for delivery to your mail accounts hosted here, see the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215832878-How-do-I-use-an-MSP-with-DreamHost-">Mail Service Provider instructions</a>.</p>
