<p>This article explains how to import email from your old DreamHost email address to your new Google Workspace email address.</p>
</div>
<h2>Step 1 — Confirm your domain has been verified</h2>
<p>Before you can migrate email, Google must first verify your domain. This usually happens within a few hours, but could potentially take up to 24 hours. You can confirm if your domain has been verified by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your <a class="panel-link" href="https://admin.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Workspace console</a>.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/gsuite-apps.png" alt="Google Workspace apps" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the 'Apps' option.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/google-workspace-services_01.png" alt="Google Workspace services" width="383" height="243" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Select the 'Google Workspace' tile.&nbsp;
<dl>
<dd><em>The following red warning appears If your domain has not been verified:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/gsuite-verify.png" alt="Google Workspace verify" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're seeing this warning, you must wait until Google has auto verified your domain. When Google has verified your domain, you will see all of your apps are enabled:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/gsuite-apps-on.png" alt="Google Workspace apps" /></dd>
</dl>
<h2>Step 2&nbsp;— Confirm your site is using an SSL certificate</h2>
<p>Before proceeding, make sure your domain is using an active <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview" target="_self">SSL certificate</a>. If it's not, you will not be able to use this method.</p>

<h2>Manually copy emails from your DreamHost account to Google Workspace</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This process involves using a mail client such as Thunderbird. You would set up both your DreamHost email address and your Google Workspace email address in this program using separate server and password credentials for each.</p>
<p>Once both are connected, simply drag and drop from your DreamHost account into your Google Workspace account. The following article walks you through this process:</p>
