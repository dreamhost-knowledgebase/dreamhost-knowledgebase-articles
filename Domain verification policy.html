<p>Due to ICANN's Transfer Policy, any change made to the registrant's name, organization, or email address will put the domain in a 60-day transfer lock; it will also trigger notification emails that are sent to the old and new registrants notifying them of the change.</p>

<p>Any Generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) New Registrations or Contact Modifications (WHOIS update for First Name, Last Name, Email Address, aka "Contact info") must be verified by the Registrant. This is a policy created by ICANN, not DreamHost.</p>

<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that coordinates the Internet's global domain name system. ICANN requires that DreamHost implement this verification policy to remain in compliance. You can read more about ICANN at the following link:</p>

<p>Generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) are popular domains such as .com, .net, .info, .org, and so on. The verification policy is required for these domains. You can view more information about a gTLD at the link below:</p>

<p>When you make any change to your WHOIS information, ICANN locks your domain for a 60-day period <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/235175787#How_can_I_opt_out">unless you opt-out</a>.</p>
<p>When you change your WHOIS information, two or more emails are sent to notify you of this change.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Do not use an email address associated with your domain as the WHOIS contact address. For example, if your domain is <strong>example.com</strong>, do NOT use an address on the same domain, such as <span class="text-object">contact@example.com</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>This email is sent to the WHOIS contact email address you have added to your registration's WHOIS information. View the following article for instructions on viewing and editing this information in the panel.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>The first email is sent from <strong>do-not-reply@dreamhostregistry.com</strong>. The second is sent from <strong>support@dreamhost.com</strong>. If you changed the WHOIS contact email, a third email is sent to the <strong>new</strong> email address.</p>
<p>If you haven't verified your contact info before, you must verify the 'Contact Info' by clicking the link in the email within 15 calendar days of the domain's registration/Contact Modification. Within those 15 days, this email is sent 4 times (Day 1, 5, 10, and 15) until the Registrant verifies it. If by the 16th day, the Registrant fails to verify the 'Contact Info', then the Domain is suspended, and a final email is sent to the Registrant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once a domain is suspended, in accordance with ICANN policy, the DNS is taken over, and a page is put up on your site stating that the domain is not verified, along with instructions for the owner to verify. An example of a suspended page is shown below.</li>
<li>Once a site is down, the site remains down indefinitely until the Registrant verifies the domain. No further emails are sent until the customer takes action.</li>
<li>Suspended domains can be renewed and can also be transferred.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>DreamHost strongly recommends un-suspending and fixing any issues on an account before proceeding with a renewal or transfer because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site service won't work in that state, and</li>
<li>A suspension due to an invalid contact also causes the transfer approval emails to go to an inactive mail user, so you likely won't be able to approve the transfer of a suspended domain name either.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visiting the site, you'll see a message stating, "You have reached a domain that is pending ICANN verification.".</p>
