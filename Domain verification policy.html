<p>Effective December 1, 2016, ICANN is revising its Transfer Policy. Any change made to the registrant's name, organization, or email address will put the domain in a 60-day transfer lock; it will also trigger notification emails that are sent to the old and new registrant notifying them of the change.</p>
<p>Please visit the following article for further details:</p>

<p>Effective <strong>January 1, 2014</strong>, any Generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) New Registrations or Contact Modifications (WHOIS update for First Name, Last Name, Email Address, aka "Contact info") must be verified by the Registrant. This is a policy created by ICANN, not DreamHost.</p>
<h2><span id="Who_is_ICANN.3F">Who is ICANN?</span></h2>
<p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization that coordinates the Internet's global domain name system. ICANN requires that DreamHost implement this verification policy in order to remain in compliance. You can read more about ICANN at the following link:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Why_do_I_have_to_do_this.3F">Why do I have to do this?</span></h2>
<p>This is the largest set of changes that are included in the RAA policy as required by ICANN. All registrars who have signed the latest RAA agreement are required to do this.</p>
<h2><span id="What_is_a_gTLD.3F">What is a gTLD?</span></h2>
<p>Generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) are popular domains such as .com, .net, .info, .org, and so on. The verification policy is required for these domains. You can view more information about a gTLD at the link below:</p>

<ul>
<li>An email is sent to the Registrant from do-not-reply@dreamhostregistry.com.</li>
<li>The content of that email varies slightly depending on if it is a <strong>New Domain Registration</strong> or a <strong>Contact Modification</strong>, but the process is identical.</li>

<p>You must verify the 'Contact Info' by clicking the link in the email within 15 calendar days of the domain's registration/Contact Modification. Within those 15 days, this email is sent 4 times (Day 1, 5, 10, and 15) until the Registrant verifies it. If by the 16th day the Registrant fails to verify the 'Contact Info', then the Domain is suspended and a final email is sent to the Registrant.</p>

<ul>
<li>The verification emails are sent by do-not-reply@dreamhostregistry.com.</li>

<ul>
<li>Once a domain is suspended, in accordance with ICANN policy, the DNS is taken over and a page is put up on your site stating that the domain is not verified along with instructions for the owner to verify. An example of a suspended page is shown below.</li>
<li>Once a site is down, the site remains down indefinitely until the Registrant verifies the domain. No further emails are sent until the customer takes action.</li>
<li>Suspended domains can be renewed and can also be transferred.</li>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>DreamHost strongly recommends un-suspending and fixing any issues on an account before proceeding with a renewal or transfer because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site service won't work in that state, and</li>
<li>A suspension due to an invalid contact also causes the transfer approval emails to go to an inactive mail user, so you likely won't be able to approve the transfer of a suspended domain name either.</li>
