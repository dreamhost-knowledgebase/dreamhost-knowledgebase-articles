<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The log4j vulnerability does not affect DreamHost's managed servers. This includes the following hosting plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared hosting</li>
<li>DreamPress</li>
<li>VPS (private servers)</li>
<li>Dedicated servers (without an admin user)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because&nbsp; DreamHost's managed servers do not provide or offer any Java tools or services that include the log4j vulnerability.</p>
<h2>Un-managed servers</h2>
<p>There are two types of DreamHost hosting plans which are UN-managed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated servers <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945467-How-do-I-add-users-to-a-Dedicated-Server-" target="_self">with an admin user</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/234961387-Getting-started-with-DreamCompute" target="_self">DreamCompute</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These types of servers allow root/sudo access which allows the admin user to manually install Java software which could potentially include calls to the vulnerable class.</p>
<p>DreamHost recommends that customers who have installed Java-based software immediately update it as soon as possible. Please submit a ticket to DreamHost support for further questions.</p>
