<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you have two VPS machines, you can use the panel to migrate all data from one to the other. This assumes you've just added a brand new VPS.</p>

<h2>Migrating</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPS</a> page.</li>
<li>To the right of the server you wish to delete, click the&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>A page opens that provides you with the option to migrate all data to a different server.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Move everything on ps### to &lt;newserver&gt; and then destroy ps###!</strong>. This ensures your data is copied to the new server where you'll continue to host your site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your data will begin to migrate to the new VPS. This could take some time, depending on how much data there is to transfer.&nbsp;</p>
