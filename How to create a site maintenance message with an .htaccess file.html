</div><h2>Pointing your site to the maintenance page</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your site is going into maintenance, you can forward visitors to a maintenance message automatically. First, you must create a file named 'maintenance.html' in your web directory.</p>
<p>View the following articles for instructions on how to create a file.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214894037-How-do-I-create-a-phprc-file-via-FTP-">How do I create a phprc file via FTP? </a></li>

</ul>
<p>Then, add the following to your .htaccess file. You only need to change the URL in bold to whatever page you'd like to display.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Options +FollowSymlinks
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/<span class="command">maintenance.html</span>$
RewriteRule .* /<span class="command">maintenance.html</span> [L]
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you now visit the site, it automatically loads the contents of the maintenance.html file, but the URL does not change.</p>
<p>You can replace [L] with [R=307,L] if you prefer that the user see the URL change to example.com/maintenance.html. However, this is usually not what you want.</p>
