<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you sign up for DreamObjects in the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">panel</a>, you receive a free 60-day trial when you won't incur any charges provided that you stay within the monthly allowances of 1000GB of storage and 1000GB of download traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usage exceeding such trial limits will be charged at <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217901038#Usage_based_billing" target="_self" rel="undefined">Usage-Based</a> billing rates.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/dreamobjects-trial-terms-and-conditions/" target="_self">DreamObjects Trial Terms &amp; Conditions</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQR4MFA4R20F08YNCNGE7HS6">Usage-Based Billing</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Usage-Based Billing means that you’re charged only if you store or download objects. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQR4MFA4BSSSNY2G206PJMCE">Prepaid plans</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Prepaid plans are good if you store a lot of data, as they offer bulk discounts over Usage-Based Billing. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQR4MFA4E3R2JWTH6GMER7F0">How is my monthly data storage calculated?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your total data usage is monitored regularly and stored in the system as bytes. DreamHost uses the maximum bytes stored during the billing period, converts that to GB, and then multiplies by the appropriate rate.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQR4MFA47GAT87BTC1PJ9YRJ">How is my monthly download bandwidth calculated?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Download bandwidth is calculated based on metered data transferred out of DreamObjects. Similar to storage, download bandwidth is stored in bytes. The aggregate number of bytes downloaded is converted to GB and then multiplied by the download rate of 5¢/GB. There is no charge for uploading data into DreamObjects.</p>
<p>You can check your usage directly inside the DreamHost Panel on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;current_step=Index&amp;next_step=Usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamObjects &gt; Usage</a> page.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQR4MFA4MD2ZPJPYBZHC9185">What happens at the end of DreamObjects free trial?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once the trial expires, you’re automatically converted to 'Usage-Based' billing unless you specify a prepaid monthly storage plan. You’ll only pay if you store or transfer files to and from DreamObjects. If you don’t use DreamObjects, you won’t owe a cent.</p>
<p>You can visualize your storage and bandwidth consumption history on <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.objects&amp;current_step=Index&amp;next_step=Usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamHost Control Panel</a> and make your decisions at the end of the trial period.</p>
