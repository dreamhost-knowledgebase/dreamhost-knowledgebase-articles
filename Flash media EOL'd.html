<p>Flash was once a popular tool for creating compelling and dynamic websites. However, in recent years the popularity of Flash has sharply declined due to security vulnerabilities, poor performance, and mobile compatibility issues.</p>
<h2>Changes at DreamHost</h2>
<p>DreamHost formerly provided Flash media tools at media.dreamhost.com for purposes of embedding video and creating image slideshows.</p>
<p>There also used to be a 'Flash Media' page in the DreamHost panel where you could convert videos to FLV format. These pages have been removed. Alternatives are mentioned below.</p>
<h2>Will my Flash scripts still work at DreamHost?</h2>
<p>If you had previously used the Flash tools on the media.dreamhost.com page, <strong>they will continue to function.</strong> </p>
<p>However, DreamHost strongly recommends using a more modern way to display your media. To help you with this, view the 'Alternatives' section below.</p>
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<h3>jwplayer</h3>
<p>If you still need to us jwplayer, you can download it from the following site to create your own installation:</p>

<h3>HTML5 image slideshow</h3>
<p>The best option is to search Google for HTML5 image slideshows. There is a very large amount of scripts available so it's a matter of finding one that best suites your needs.</p>
<h3>Video converter</h3>
<p>An FLV converter is no longer necessary even if you wish to continue to use Flash Player. This is because HTML5 is a new and better alternative which supports video formats that can play on third party Flash players. View the following article for further details on HTML5 video.</p>
