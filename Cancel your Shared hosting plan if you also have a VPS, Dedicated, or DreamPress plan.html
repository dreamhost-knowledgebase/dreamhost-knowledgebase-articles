<p>The following instructions are only if you have a Shared hosting plan in addition to a VPS, Dedicated, or DreamPress plan.</p>
<h2>Viewing your hosting plan type</h2>
<p>You can view all services billed to your account on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Billing &amp; Account' &gt; 'Manage Account')</a> page. Here you'll see a list of all services you currently use.</p>

<p>You must remove all users from the Shared server in order to proceed. First, make sure you backup any important files under the Shared user you wish to keep. View the following articles for information on how to backup your user data:</p>

</ul>
<p>Once your data has been backed up, navigate to the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.users&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Users' &gt; 'Manage Users')</a> page. To the right of any user (under the 'Machine' column) you'll see the name of the server. For example, 'flower', 'gervais', 'tool' etc. Your VPS will instead look like ps123456.</p>
<p>If it has a name, it is a Shared server.</p>
