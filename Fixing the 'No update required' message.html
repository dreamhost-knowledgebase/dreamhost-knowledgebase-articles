<p>When logging into your WordPress site, you may see the following message:</p>
<p><strong>No Update Required Your WordPress database is already up-to-date!</strong></p>
<p>This often is an issue with your site's cache. To resolve this, log into your server and flush the cache via SSH.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to your WordPress directory. Here you'll see all of your files and folders.</li>
<li>In this directory, run the following command.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">wp cache flush</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That should fix the cache issue and you should no longer see the message when logging in.</p>
