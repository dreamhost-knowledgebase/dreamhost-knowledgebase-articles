<p>The sexual exploitation of minors (including child pornography) is strictly against US Federal law and (it goes without saying) DreamHost's <a class=" " href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<p>If you have encountered child pornography (or any form of sexual exploitation of minors, for that matter), please <a class=" " href="mailto:abuse@dreamhost.com" rel="nofollow">contact </a>DreamHost immediately. You may also want to contact law enforcement as well, either directly or through the <a class=" " href="http://www.ncmec.org/" rel="nofollow">NCMEC</a> as described below.</p>
<h2><span id="FAQs">FAQs</span></h2>
<p>The following are common questions and misunderstandings about DreamHost's policies on child exploitation and child pornography.</p>
<h3><span id="What_is_child_pornography.3F">What is child pornography?</span></h3>
<p>Legally, for something to be considered child pornography under US Federal law it must portray minors (that is, children under the age of 18) engaging in sexual activities or posed in a sexually suggestive manner (cite: <a class=" " href="http://laws.findlaw.com/3rd/940734p.html" rel="nofollow">United States v. Knox</a>). Actual children must be portrayed, so (for example) drawings or written fictional accounts are not illegal.</p>
<p>In any case, if a specific instance even appears to be at all border-line, DreamHost would still like to be notified.</p>
<h3><span id="Why_is_that_site_still_up.3F">Why is that site still up?</span></h3>
<p>At times, people may notice that clearly illegal sites reported to DreamHost remain online for some time.</p>
<p>While DreamHost recognizes that such sites staying online for any length of time seems abhorrent, the real damage that occurs with child pornography—the abuse of those children pictured—is DreamHost's primary concern. It is also the primary concern of law enforcement, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). For this reason, we are often asked to keep such sites online during the investigative process as this greatly facilitates actually catching the criminals involved and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of such investigations, DreamHost is are unable to comment on what is taking place behind the scenes. However, if you want to make absolutely sure that the matter is followed-up upon you may file a formal complaint with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, here:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>They have an official relationship with many law enforcement agencies (including the FBI), and will route your complaint to the proper location.</p>
