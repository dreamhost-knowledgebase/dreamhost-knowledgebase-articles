<p>This article describes the various ways you can upgrade or downgrade from a Dedicated Hosting plan.</p>
<h3>Downgrading to Shared Starter</h3>
<p>If you would like to downgrade from a Dedicated Server to a Shared Starter hosting plan, make sure you fall within the limitations described in the following article:</p>

<h3>Downgrading to shared or VPS plan</h3>
<p>First, make sure you've added a shared or VPS hosting plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001371926-Adding-a-Shared-hosting-plan-to-your-domain-only-account" target="_self" rel="undefined">Adding a Shared Hosting plan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945617-Adding-a-private-server-VPS-" target="_self">Adding a private server (VPS)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can then delete the Dedicated Server.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003900531-Deleting-a-Dedicated-server" target="_self" rel="undefined">Deleting a Dedicated Server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When deleting, you will see a message informing you that everything on the Dedicated Server will be migrated to the shared or VPS server.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you have both a shared and VPS server on your account, only the VPS server will show as an option to migrate to when deleting your Dedicated Server.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to migrate to a shared server, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">contact support</a>. DreamHost support will then migrate the data for you.</p>

<h3>Migrating to DreamPress</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to migrate an existing WordPress site to DreamPress.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300567-Upgrade-a-WordPress-site-to-DreamPress" target="_self">Upgrade a WordPress site to DreamPress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you only had the single WordPress site on your Dedicated Server, you can then cancel it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003900531-Deleting-a-Dedicated-server" target="_self" rel="undefined">Deleting a Dedicated Server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other sites on the Dedicated Server, you must continue paying for that plan since only the single site would have been migrated to DreamPress.</p>
<h3>Migrating to a different Dedicated Hosting plan</h3>
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email" target="_self">Contact support</a> if you would like to migrate data from a Dedicated Server to a different Dedicated Server. Support will then migrate the data for you.</p>
