<dd>The <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Contact Support</a> page allows you to submit a support request to DreamHost Technical Support. The Contact Support section includes several methods for getting support, including:
<ul>
<li>Submitting a support request, which provides links for specific issues</li>
<li>Posting about an emergency</li>
<li>Requesting Live Chat support</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can also view additional support information by:
<ul>
<li>Reading posts on the <a href="http://discussion.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost Discussion Forum</a></li>
<li>Viewing updates on the <a href="http://status.dreamhost.com/">Emergency Status</a> page</li>
</ul>

<dd>Most queries can be answered by searching the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us">Knowledge Base</a>, or the <a href="http://discussion.dreamhost.com/">discussion forum</a>, and these should be the first ports of call in the event of a problem. If those fail to provide a solution, submitting a support request will get a response within a reasonable amount of time.</dd>
