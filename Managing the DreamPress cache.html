<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress includes built-in server caching, which speeds up your site significantly. Since caching creates static versions of your site, fewer resources are needed by the server when a customer visits your site. This allows your site to not only load faster but also helps manage larger amounts of traffic. However, when caching is not working, your site will typically run slower, and your resource usage will increase.</p>
</div>
<h2>Do I need a caching plugin?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress sites can access two server caching options: <span class="text-object">Proxy Cache</span> (All DreamPress plans) and <span class="text-object">Redis Cache</span> (DreamPress Pro only). Many WordPress guides, including <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-website-caching/" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamHost's</a>, recommend caching plugins like WP Super Cache on WordPress sites. However, since DreamPress has built-in caching, a third-party caching plugin such as WP Super Cache is unnecessary and might conflict with the DreamPress cache. Instead, DreamHost recommends using its built-in server cache on your DreamPress site.</p>
<h3>Proxy Cache Purge</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/varnish-http-purge/">Proxy Cache Purge</a> plugin is optimized to provide all the tools you need to automatically manage the DreamPress cache and analyze your site's ability to cache. Disabling the plugin doesn't disable the cache, as it's simply a tool to help determine if the cache is working properly. The Proxy Cache Purge plugin comes preinstalled on all new and upgraded DreamPress installations. If you've copied over an existing WordPress site from another host to DreamPress, installing this plugin is highly recommended so that managing your DreamPress cache is automated and does not require your attention under normal circumstances. For more information on the Proxy Cache Purge plugin and how to use it, see the following article:</p>

<h3>Redis Object Cache</h3>
<p>DreamPress Pro plans also have access to Redis Object Cache, which stores WordPress objects in memory. For more information on Redis Object Cache, see the following article:</p>

<h2>When would I need to purge my cache?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you make changes to your site, such as customizing or creating new content, the new changes may not show live because your site's old version is cached. Purging your cache can help to push your changes live so visitors see the most recent version of your site.</p>
