<h2 id="h_01HD4QYPNEMQSGCKE8DJWTBXMZ">Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress includes built-in server caching, which speeds up your site significantly. Since caching creates static versions of your site, fewer resources are needed by the server when a customer visits your site. This allows your site to not only load faster but also helps manage larger amounts of traffic. However, when caching is not working, your site will typically run slower, and your resource usage will increase.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HD4QYPNE2ZSQBKF9MKR12M96">Do I need a caching plugin?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Both the Nginx Helper Plugin and Redis Cache work in tandem and are included/preconfigured on all DreamPress Pro plans.</p>
</div>
<p>DreamPress sites can access two server caching options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/20105684094228-Managing-DreamPress-cache-with-the-Nginx-Helper-plugin"><span class="text-object">Nginx Helper Plugin</span></a> — manages the Nginx server cache, which covers pages for logged out users.</li>
<li><span class="text-object">Redis Cache</span> (DreamPress Pro only) — manages the Redis server cache. Redis is a service that only runs on DreamPress Pro accounts (due to the extra memory that it requires), which caches common queries to make load times faster for uncached pages (WooCommerce cart pages, pages that have fallen out of the Nginx cache, and so on) as well as logged-in users (wp-admin, membership sites, and so on).</li>
</ul>
<p>Many guides recommend caching plugins such as WP Super Cache on WordPress sites. However, since DreamPress comes with built-in caching, third-party caching plugins are not necessary and could even conflict with the built-in DreamPress cache.</p>
<p>For optimal performance, make sure the version of the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/20105684094228-Managing-DreamPress-cache-with-the-Nginx-Helper-plugin">Nginx Helper plugin</a> is always <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300817#Updating_plugins">up to date</a>, as it provides helpful tools to manage your DreamPress site's cache.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HD4QYPNEFZT9GWXFDGW8CEWY">Redis Object Cache</h3>
<p>DreamPress Pro plans also have access to Redis Object Cache, which stores WordPress objects in memory. For more information on Redis Object Cache, see the following article:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HD4QYPNEG23VVNHM6TE79C1J">When would I need to purge my cache?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you make changes to your site, such as customizing or creating new content, the new changes may not show live because your site's old version is cached. Purging your cache can help to push your changes live so visitors see the most recent version of your site. View the following articles for details on how to purge your cache:</p>
