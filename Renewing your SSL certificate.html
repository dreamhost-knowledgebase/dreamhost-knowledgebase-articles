<h2><span id="when_renew">When should I renew my certificate?</span></h2>
<p>Make sure you renew the certificate <strong>BEFORE</strong> the expiration date. This ensures you do not lose any protection.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you renew before the expiration date, you <strong>do not</strong> lose any time on your current certificate that you've already paid for.</p>
<h2>How to renew a certificate</h2>
<p>SSL certificates do not auto-renew by default. You must manually renew them within your panel.</p>
<p>Certificate Authorities typically send expiration/renewal reminders to the admin address anywhere from 30 to 90 days before the certificate’s expiration date. This is to let you know that you MUST take action to renew the SSL certificate. DreamHost sends SSL certificate renewal notices to the primary contact address of the account 35 days before the expiration date of the certificate. You can then manually initiate the renewal process in your panel.</p>
<p>There are two ways to renew your signed SSL certificate, which are described in the following sections.</p>
<h3><span id="purchase_panel">Renewing your signed certificate by purchasing a renewal in your panel</span></h3>
<p>Renewing your certificate in your panel is basically the same procedure as purchasing a new <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-">professionally-signed SSL certificate</a>. To further help the renewal process, your current SSL certificate is:</p>
<ul>
<li>already recognized by the DreamHost system as expiring soon and processes a renewal order for you.</li>
<li>automatically renewed and installed to your panel after the order is approved.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="renew_panel">Renewing your signed certificate by clicking the renew button in your panel</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Secure Hosting’</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Renew_SSL.png" alt="15 Renew SSL.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the 'Show' link next to 'Inactive SSL Certificates'.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Renew_SSL_renew_link.png" alt="15 Renew SSL renew link.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>To the right of your domain click the 'Renew' link.</li>
<li>Review your information on the next page and click <strong>Renew now!</strong>.
<dl>
<dd><em>A success message appears confirming the SSL certificate was renewed.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An email is sent to you that includes further information once the system has updated the certificate.</p>
<h3><span id="does_not_complete">What if my Comodo SSL certificate does not complete the renewal process?</span></h3>
<p>There may be situations when you renew your Comodo certificate in the panel, but it does not show as completed (typically shows 'Unknown' as the Expires value, which means the order has not completed). Usually this is due to a failure to respond to the request email sent to the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order.</p>
<p>If you did not receive the DCV email to confirm your SSL certificate order, then follow these steps to reissue a new email request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Secure Hosting’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click 'Settings' under the right hand side for the domain.</li>
<li>When the Settings page opens, click the <strong>Resend DCV</strong> button.</li>
<li>Be sure to use a valid email address to send the order confirmation to.
<dl>
<dd><em>The DCV email is sent to the address you specified. Check your email, and then respond to the request. After the DCV email is confirmed, it can take up to an hour for the SSL certificate to become active.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="another_ca">Renewing your certificate with another Certificate Authority</span></h2>
<p>If you wish to renew the certificate with another Certificate Authority (CA), you can simply copy the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that's currently in your panel and use it to initiate the renewal process with them. You can access your CSR by following the instructions described in the following article:</p>
