<h2><span id="How_to_renew_a_certificate">How to renew a certificate</span></h2>
<p>SSL certificates do not auto-renew by default. You must manually renew them within your panel.</p>
<p>Certificate Authorities typically send expiration/renewal reminders to the admin address anywhere from 30 to 90 days before the certificate’s expiration date. This is to let you know that you MUST take action to renew the SSL certificate. DreamHost sends SSL certificate renewal notices to the primary contact address of the account 35 days before the expiration date of the certificate. You can then manually initiate the renewal process in your panel.</p>
<p>There are two ways to renew your signed SSL certificate which are described in the following sections.</p>
<h2><span id="Renewing_your_signed-certificate_by_purchasing_a_renewal_in_your_panel">Renewing your signed-certificate by purchasing a renewal in your panel</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>This is basically the same procedure as purchasing a new <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-">professionally-signed SSL certificate</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The system already recognizes that your current SSL certificate is going to expire soon and processes a renewal order for you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once the order has been approved, your renewed SSL certificate is installed in to your panel automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Renewing_your_signed-certificate_by_clicking_the_renew_button_in_your_panel">Renewing your signed-certificate by clicking the renew button in your panel</span></h2>

</ol>
<h2><span id="Renewing_your_certificate_with_another_Certificate_Authority">Renewing your certificate with another Certificate Authority</span></h2>
<p>If you wish to renew the certificate with another Certificate Authority, you can simply copy the Certificate Signing Request that's currently in your panel and use it to initiate the renewal process with them. You can access your Certificate Signing Request by following the instructions in the Purchasing a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089778-What-do-I-need-from-DreamHost-before-purchasing-a-third-party-SSL-certificate-">Signed Certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA)</a> article.</p>

<p>If you cannot find an available Certificate Signing Request in the panel for the domain/subdomain, please see the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084098-CSR-overview">Generating or Regenerating a CSR</a> article instructions on how to replace it.</p>

<h2>When should you renew the certificate?</h2>
<p>Make sure you renew the certificate <strong>BEFORE</strong> the expiration date. This ensures you will not lose any protection.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you renew before the expiration date, you <strong>will not</strong> lose any time on your current certificate which you've already paid for.</p>
