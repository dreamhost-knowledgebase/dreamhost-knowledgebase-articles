<h2><span id="Databases">Databases</span></h2>
<p>Your database holds all of the key information of your website. Failure to protect it means not only potential loss of private information such as usernames, email addresses, and more, but also allows an attacker to possibly add entries which could create spam or malware links on your site (or worse). Therefore, you must consider how your database(s) are accessed for routine maintenance.</p>
<h2><span id="Keeping_your_software_updated">Keeping your software updated</span></h2>
<p>Websites are often hacked via security holes found in old versions of web software, such as web forums, wikis, and blogs. It's your responsibility to keep the website's applications updated with the latest version.</p>
<p>DreamHost's <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089938-What-One-Click-Installs-does-DreamHost-offer-">One-Click Installs</a> are automatically updated, if you select the option to auto update. If you do not enable the auto upgrade feature, you are responsible for keeping your applications up to date.</p>
<p>Some applications (e.g., <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217071817-Joomla">Joomla</a>) do not provide an upgrade path from older versions, which will then need to be updated manually. Please check with the application’s developers for further assistance on upgrading.</p>
<h2><span id="Setting_file_permissions">Setting file permissions</span></h2>
<p>When <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214751018-UNIX-commands-Changing-permissions">setting up file permissions</a>, DreamHost recommends that you set the permissions to the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Files – chmod 644
Directories – chmod 755
Executables – chmod 755
</pre>
</div>
<p>Here is an example on how this should look:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ls -al</span>
<span class="cmdoutput">drwxr-xr-x 2 exampleuser pg5034488  10 Apr 22 09:13 example_directory
-rwxr-xr-x 1 exampleuser pg5034488   0 Apr 22 09:14 example_executable.cgi
-rw-r--r-- 1 exampleuser pg5034488   0 Apr 22 09:12 example_file.php
</span></pre>
</div>

<h2><span id="Assigning_a_unique_user_to_each_domain">Assigning a unique user to each domain</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost recommends that you host each of your individual sites with its own unique <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216745348-Users-panel">web user</a>. The reason for this is that if one of your sites becomes compromised, the exploit won't expand to your other sites.</p>
<h2><span id="Enhanced_user_security">Enhanced user security</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215282088-How-do-I-set-up-Enhanced-User-Security-">Enhanced User Security</a> setting prevents a user's home directory from being accessed by other DreamHost users. This option is enabled separately for each user in the panel, and it's strongly recommended that you enable this option unless it is necessary for other users to access your data. If it is disabled, incorrectly set permissions can allow any DreamHost user to read or possibly modify your data, including passwords held in configuration files.</p>

<h2><span id="Managing_your_files_on_the_server">Managing your files on the server</span></h2>
<p>When connecting to your server to manage your files, DreamHost recommends that you use either <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>. FTP is not secure and should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3><span id="SSH">SSH</span></h3>
<p>SSH, secure shell, is the preferred method for connecting to your machine. SSH encrypts the communication from the local machine and the destination machine. This means that your password is not being transmitted in plain text, which is what TELNET does.</p>
<p>SSH must be turned on for your users. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Enabling-Shell-access">Enabling Shell Access</a> article for details.</p>
<h3><span id="SFTP_instead_of_FTP">SFTP instead of FTP</span></h3>
<p>Since FTP is not secure, SFTP is only recommended when connecting to your server. View the SFTP article for details.</p>
<h2><span id="Serving_your_files_securely">Serving your files securely</span></h2>
<p>There may be situations when you wish to serve your files securely, such as if you are running an eCommerce website: obviously, you wouldn’t want to send vital information over the Internet without protection.</p>
<p>To add an extra layer of security, you can set up secure hosting and purchase an SSL certificate. You can find more information about how to set up these services in the following article:</p>
