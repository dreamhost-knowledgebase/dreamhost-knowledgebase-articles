<p>PHP is a popular server-side scripting language used by many web software and
non-web software packages, and popular with DreamHost customers.  PHP is an
important part of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stacks as well as other AMP
stacks.  You can use it for your DreamCompute instance as well, and the
following information helps you install and configure it.  These instructions
assume you run a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system as they have their own
specific configuration and file hierarchy.</p>
<div id="installing-php">
<h2>Installing PHP</h2>
<p>PHP comes in different configuration packages on Debian and Ubuntu systems to
meet your needs for the command line interface (CLI) client or the apache
module (mod_php aka libphp5.so) or other specializations.</p>
<div id="php-cli-only">
<h3>PHP CLI Only</h3>
<p>This will install the /usr/bin/php binary and php.ini file.  This is normally
used for running scripts in SSH and for cron jobs, or for development, but
isn’t directly usable for websites on apache.</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">[root@server]#</span> apt-get install php5-cli
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The install process asks you to confirm if you wish to install any additional
packages needed for this installation of PHP.  Confirm by entering “<strong>y</strong>”
and hitting enter:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The following extra packages will be installed:
libonig2 libqdbm14 php5-common
Suggested packages:
php-pear
The following NEW packages will be installed:

<div id="php-apache-module-cli">
<h3>PHP Apache Module + CLI</h3>
<p>This will install the /usr/bin/php binary and php.ini file, as well as the
apache module located at /usr/lib/apache2/modules/libphp5.so and its own
php.ini file.</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">[root@server]#</span> apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The install process will enable the php5 module for you, and restart apache.
If you wish to double check that it is enabled, you can use the a2enmod
program:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">[root@server]#</span> a2enmod php5
<span class="go">Module php5 already enabled</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you do disable or enable modules, make sure to restart apache with the
service command:</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">[root@server]#</span> service apache2 restart
<span class="go">[ ok ] Restarting web server: apache2 ... waiting .</span>
</pre></div>

<div id="configuration-files">
<h2>Configuration Files</h2>
<p>There are two configuration files for PHP that are used for the CLI and the
apache modules specifically.  The thinking is that you would want saner
defaults for PHP when accessed from the web because it is probably your
production environment.  The CLI on the other hand, is more likely your
development environment and should be less restricted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>/etc/php5/cli/php.ini</strong></p>
<p>The primary configuration file for PHP when executed from the CLI.  It has
no memory_limit at all, and allows all functions (including <a class="reference external" href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pcntl.php">POSIX PHP
functions</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini</strong></p>
<p>The primary configuration file for PHP when ran from the apache module.  It
has a memory_limit of 128MB, and disallows all functions related to <a class="reference external" href="http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pcntl.php">POSIX
PHP functions</a> for security and
safety reasons.</p>
