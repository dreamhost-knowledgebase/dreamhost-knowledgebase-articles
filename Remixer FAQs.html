<p>At this time, Remixer does not have an HTML editor built in or any method to access the actual HTML files.</p>
<p>Remixer themes and 'Web Sections' have been specifically designed to look and fit a certain way, and DreamHost recommends you use the Remix option under each 'Web Section' if you wish to try a different section style.</p>
<h3>Do I need anything else?</h3>
<p>No. All you need is a computer/browser and the ability to point, click, drag, and drop!</p>

<h2>Common errors and troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>My domain is showing a 'Page Not Found' site</h3>
<p>The following page appears on your domain or sub-domain when the page does not publish to the web server correctly:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/remixer_faq.01.fw.png" alt="remixer_faq.01.fw.png" width="611" height="531" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Review the following instructions on how to publish to your domain name:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/230663347-How-do-I-publish-my-first-Remixer-page-to-a-domain-">How do I publish my first Remixer page to a domain?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>I just published, but my domain isn’t loading the site yet</h3>
<p>Double-check to make sure you have assigned the domain or sub-domain to your page on the Pages menu.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>DNS changes are required if you are publishing to your domain or sub-domain on Remixer for the first time.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your domain’s nameservers are pointed to DreamHost, it automatically updates for you within 24 to 48 hours.</li>
<li>If your domain’s nameservers are not pointed to DreamHost, you must update the DNS records A records at the company that hosts your nameservers. You would point them to your site's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">A records</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remixer requires that your DreamHost Panel web hosting for the domain is set to “DNS Only” prior to publishing. To set up DNS only:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/remixer_dns_remove_panel.fw.png" alt="remixer_dns_remove_panel.fw.png" width="215" height="101" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the 'Remove' link under the Web Hosting column.</li>
<li>Return back to Remixer and republish your site from Pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your site should be visible after a few hours of DNS propagation.</p>
