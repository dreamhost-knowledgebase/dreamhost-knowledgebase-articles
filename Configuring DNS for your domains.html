<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DNS is the technology that allows your domain to point to a specific IP address and allows the server listening on it to host your domain. There are several different types of records, but the most commonly used ones are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A - Used to link a domain or subdomain to an IPv4 address.</li>
<li>AAAA - Used to link a domain or subdomain to an IPv6 address.</li>
<li>CNAME - Used to link a domain or subdomain to another domain or subdomain.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most purposes, youâ€™ll only need to use A and AAAA records.</p>

<h2>Locating your public IP address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each DreamCompute instance in the US-East 2 cluster is assigned a public IPv4 and IPv6 address.</p>
<p>You can view these addresses in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://iad2.dreamcompute.com/project/instances/">Instances</a>&nbsp;page of the DreamCompute dashboard</li>
<li>Using the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/235817468-Getting-started-with-the-OpenStack-command-line-client">OpenStack command line client</a></li>

<p>If you have multiple instances, you will have multiple public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You will need to track which addresses host which websites or other services.</p>

<h2>Adding IP addresses to your domain in the DreamHost panel</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To add a new IP address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set your domain to 'DNS Only'. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360056398191-Setting-your-domain-to-DNS-Only-" target="_self">Setting your domain to 'DNS Only'</a> article for more information.
<ul>
<li>Make sure your domain is already hosted. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932#adding-a-domain" target="_self" rel="undefined">Adding a website and hosting</a> article for more information on how to add hosting to a domain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a new A record for the domain or subdomain. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360035516812#A_record" target="_self">Adding custom DNS records</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Create additional A records as needed for domains you wish to host on your instance. You can also create an A record for the non-www version of your site URL. All you need to do is leave the 'Host' field blank.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Waiting for DNS propagation</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After the DNS entries are saved, the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> which can take several hours. The default TTL (time-to-live) for DreamHost nameservers is 5 minutes, so any change to your DNS records should be updated nearly everywhere around the world within that time.</p>
