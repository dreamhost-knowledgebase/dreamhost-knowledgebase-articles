<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>WordPress provides a debug tool to help discover what may be the cause of an error on your website. This tool can display information on your live website, however, this is not recommended if your website is live to the public. Instead, it's recommended to create a debug log file. You can then check that log file to determine the cause of the issue you're attempting to resolve.</p>
<p>This article walks you through how to enable Debug mode and write to a log file without disturbing your live website.</p>
</div>
<h2>Enabling DEBUG mode</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview" target="_self">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials" target="_self">FTP</a>.</li>
<li>Edit the <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> file using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH" target="_self">SSH</a> or your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP" target="_self">FTP client</a>.</li>
<li>Near the bottom of the file you'll see the following:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('WP_DEBUG', false);</pre>
</div>
Adjust that line to these three lines:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>It's not recommended to change WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY to true. This is because any errors will then display on your live website. By enabling WP_DEBUG_LOG, you can view the same errors in your <span class="text-object">/wp-content/debug.log</span> file.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>When an error is thrown in WordPress, it will write to a file titled <span class="text-object">debug.log</span>. This file is located in your <span class="text-object">/wp-content/</span> directory. Open this file using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH" target="_self">SSH</a> or your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP" target="_self">FTP client</a>&nbsp;to view the debug report.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Viewing your debug log using a plugin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
