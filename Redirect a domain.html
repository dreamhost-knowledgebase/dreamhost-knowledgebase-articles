<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h2 id="h_01HZPXAVQ9KF98R9GCYMVSR6JD">What is a redirect domain?</h2>
<p>A "redirect" domain acts as a pointer to another domain. When accessing a web page on the redirected domain, the browser's URL is changed to the domain to which it is being redirected. When setting this up through the DreamHost panel, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#3xx_Redirection">301</a> redirect is created automatically.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The panel <span class="text-product">Redirect</span> service requires that you have an active <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-" target="_self">hosting plan</a> for the domain or that the domain is registered with DreamHost.</p>
<p>Additionally, the examples in this article use the <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> protocol. For this to work, the domain you're redirecting to must already <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">have an SSL certificate configured</a>. If not, use <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> instead.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HZPXAVQ9KF98R9GCYMVSR6JD">How does the redirect work?</h2>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Setting a redirect does not delete your current website or any of its files. You can add hosting back to the domain in the future at any time, which then displays your original content.</p>
</div>
<p>Any page you visit on your current site (the one being redirected) is forwarded to the page on the redirected site. For example, let's say you're redirecting <strong>example.com</strong> to <strong>dreamhost.com</strong>. If you visit <strong>example.com/contact.html</strong>, the URL changes to <strong>dreamhost.com/contact.html</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HZPXAVQ9WC4HH7HS2EZQ27X9">Does redirecting work for the www and non-www versions of the site?</h2>
<p>Yes. If you set up a redirect on <strong>example.com</strong>, it also will work for <strong>www.example.com</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HZPXAVQ99RWAK8AEFDH4EG91">Does the redirect change MX records?</h2>
<p>No. The redirect only changes where the website is hosted. Your MX (mail) records will not be changed in any way.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HZPXAVQ9K1BSKAQ5MC1WKKKZ"><span id="redirect_to_https">Does redirecting work with https (SSL certificate)?</span></h2>
<p>There are a few different ways this could be configured:</p>
<h3 id="h_01HQPD4CK3Z754DEXCSZFARVRR">Option 1 — Redirecting to the secure version of a different site</h3>
<p>You can only redirect to another site that's already configured with an SSL certificate. For example:</p>
<p><strong>http://example.com </strong>to<strong> https://dreamhostexample.com</strong></p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>You must first <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview" target="_self">add an SSL certificate</a> to the domain you are redirecting TO (<strong>https://dreamhostexample.com</strong>). If an SSL certificate is not configured, you will see a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613517-Site-not-found" target="_self">Site Not Found</a> error when viewing the redirect.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HQPD4CK38H03T6CAT57956HA">Option 2 — Redirecting to the secure version of the same site</h3>
<p>It's impossible to use the panel's Redirect option (described below) to redirect to <span class="text-object">HTTPS,</span> as this removes hosting from the domain. For example:</p>
<p><strong>http://example.com </strong>to<strong> https://example.com</strong></p>
<p>This is also unnecessary since after adding<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">&nbsp;an SSL certificate</a> to your domain, DreamHost automatically redirects the URL visitors use to view your site from <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>. The <span class="text-object">S</span> ensures that your connection is encrypted. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https</strong>://example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>There's nothing you need to do on your end to force your site to use the secure URL. However, in some special cases, you may need to create your own custom configuration file to force the redirect from <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>Adding custom code is only necessary if your website requires specific code to force the redirect</strong>. If so, you will need to first disable the automatic redirect in your panel.</p>

</ul>
<p>Once disabled, you can then proceed with <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003505112-Force-your-site-to-redirect-to-HTTPS-SSL-" target="_self">adding your custom redirect file</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQPD4CK33W01J6V8DJX0B25E">Creating a redirect to a subdirectory</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you need to redirect to a subdirectory of another site, add a trailing forward slash to the redirect URL. If you do not, the URL will not redirect correctly.</p>
<p>For example, if your site is <strong>example.com</strong> and you want to redirect to a subdirectory of another site called <span class="text-object">dreamhostexample.com/blog</span>, make sure the redirect you create adds the trailing forward slash like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">dreamhostexample.com/blog/</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not add the forward slash, any files accessed within that subdirectory will not load since the URL will be incorrect.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You cannot redirect to a subdirectory of the same website.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQPD4CK3CZHCCVVQ3NQ557S0">Turning off a Redirect</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To turn off a Redirect, you must change the hosting configuration to any other option, such as 'Fully Hosted' or 'DNS Only'. View the following articles for instructions:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQPD4CK391P0VSSD87YCGMDZ">How long until the redirect is working?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Redirecting your site is the same as any other DNS change. This means the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> before you can see the changes online. In general, this shouldn't take any longer than 6 hours. You can keep track of when the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">new DNS records</a> update in different locations using either of the following links:</p>
