<p>You can use websites like <a href="http://whois-search.com">http://whois-search.com</a> to check the current WHOIS records for domains. This is the simplest way to search for the domain registration and ownership information stored in the public database.</p>
<h2><span id="Entering_a_WHOIS_query_from_the_command_line">Entering a WHOIS query from the command line</span></h2>
<p>You can also perform a WHOIS query from your computer if your operating system supports this. Open a terminal on your computer and run a WHOIS query from a telnet command line. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">whois example.com</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>For some domain extensions, you may need to check the record directly on that specific domain’s WHOIS server. However, there is no current standard for determining the responsible WHOIS server for a domain extension. Some WHOIS lookups require some extra work, such as performing the search through the specific registrar of the domain name to retrieve ownership details.</p>

</ul>
<p>In most cases, it is easiest to use a third-party WHOIS searching site to perform your WHOIS lookup queries.</p>
<h2><span id="Breaking_down_a_WHOIS_query">Breaking down a WHOIS query</span></h2>
<p>There are two parts to a WHOIS query:</p>
<ul>
<li>The central registry information</li>
<li>The registrar information</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="The_central_registry_information">The central registry information</span></h3>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Domain Name: DREAMHOST.COM
Registrar: DREAMHOST, LLC
Sponsoring Registrar IANA ID: 431
Whois Server: whois.dreamhost.com

</div>
<p>The central registry information shows the domain name in question, what company provided registration services, a link to their WHOIS server, the domain status, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a>, and create/expire dates. After you have this information, your WHOIS client will generally connect to the registrar's server to look up the contact information. The information in the central registry is updated roughly every 24 hours, so if you see information in the registrars WHOIS section that is different than the central registry, try again in abut 24 hours.</p>
