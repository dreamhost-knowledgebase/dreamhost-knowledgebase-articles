<p>On November 1, 2018, Comodo announced that the company is rebranding to Sectigo. For more information about this, please see the following announcement at Sectigo's website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sectigo.com/sectigo-story-faq">Comodo CA Is Now Sectigo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Any Comodo certificate issued after January 2019 will reference Sectigo as the certificate authority, while any certificates issued prior to that will still reference Comodo. These are still the same company, and the only difference is the name.</p>

<p>The following describes how to renew <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-">professionally-signed SSL certificates</a> purchased through Sectigo.</p>
</div><h2><span id="when_renew">When should I renew my certificate?</span></h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure you renew the certificate <strong>BEFORE</strong> the expiration date. This ensures you do not lose any protection.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you renew before the expiration date, you <strong>do not</strong> lose any time on your current certificate that you've already paid for.</p>
</div><h2>How to renew a certificate in the panel</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>SSL certificates do not auto-renew by default. You must manually renew them within your panel.</p>
<p>Certificate Authorities typically send expiration/renewal reminders to the admin address anywhere from 30 to 90 days before the certificate’s expiration date. This is to let you know that you MUST take action to renew the SSL certificate. DreamHost sends SSL certificate renewal notices to the primary contact address of the account 35 days before the expiration date of the certificate. You can then manually initiate the renewal process in your panel.</p>
<p>There are two options to renew your Sectigo signed SSL certificate, which are described in the following sections.</p>
<h3><span id="purchase_panel">Option 1 — Purchasing a renewal</span></h3>
<p>Renewing your certificate in your panel is basically the same procedure as purchasing a new professionally-signed SSL certificate.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Renewing the certificate before its expiration date <strong>does not</strong> remove any time on your current certificate that you've already paid for. The new certificate will being to function once the current one expires.</p>
<h3>Option 2 <span id="purchase_panel">— </span><span id="renew_panel">Renewing your certificate in the panel (before it's expired)</span></h3>
<p>To renew a Sectigo certificate (before it's expired) by clicking the Renew button in the panel.</p>

<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify. So it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h3><span id="does_not_complete">What if my Sectigo SSL certificate does not complete the renewal process?</span></h3>
<p>There may be situations when your renewal does not complete, even though you renewed your Sectigo certificate in the panel. Typically this shows as 'Unknown' for the Expires value, which is usually due to a failure to respond to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-#dcv_confirm_email">request email</a> sent to the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order.</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> respond to the email that is sent in order to successfully complete the renewal of the certificate.</p>
<p>If you did not receive the DCV email to confirm your SSL certificate order, then follow these steps to reissue a new email request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Settings</strong> button to the right of the domain.</li>
<li>When the Settings page opens, click the <strong>Resend DCV</strong> button.</li>
<li>Be sure to use a valid email address to send the order confirmation to.
<dl>
<dd><em>The DCV email is sent to the address you specified. Check your email, and then respond to the request. After the DCV email is confirmed, it can take up to an hour for the SSL certificate to become active.</em></dd>

</div><h2><span id="another_ca">Renewing your certificate with another Certificate Authority</span></h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you wish to renew the certificate with another Certificate Authority (CA), you can simply copy the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that's currently in your panel and use it to initiate the renewal process with them.
