<h2>When should I renew my certificate?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215202667-Making-a-payment#autopay" target="_self">AutoPay</a> <strong>and</strong> the domain on which you installed the Sectigo certificate is hosted at DreamHost, then the certificate will be auto-renewed. You do not need to renew it or re-enter any payment information when the certificate is due for renewal, as the renewal process will be handled for you.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference internal" href="#auto_renewal" target="_self">Sectigo auto-renew section</a> below for more information.</p>
</div>
<p>Make sure you renew the certificate <strong>BEFORE</strong> the expiration date. This ensures you do not lose any protection.</p>
<p>Please note that even if you renew before the expiration date, you <strong>do not</strong> lose any time on your current certificate that you've already paid for.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to renew a certificate in the panel</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Certificate Authorities typically send expiration/renewal reminders to the admin address anywhere from 30 to 90 days before the certificate’s expiration date. DreamHost sends SSL certificate renewal notices to the primary contact address of the account 35 days before the expiration date of the certificate.</p>
<p>There are several options to renew your Sectigo signed SSL certificate, which are described in the following sections.</p>
<h3><span id="purchase_panel">Option 1 — Purchasing a renewal</span></h3>
<p>Renewing your certificate in your panel is basically the same procedure as purchasing a new professionally-signed SSL certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-Purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate">Purchase a professionally-signed SSL certificate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Renewing the certificate before its expiration date&nbsp;<strong>does not&nbsp;</strong>remove any time on your current certificate that you've already paid for. The new certificate will being to function once the current one expires.</p>
<h3><span id="renew_panel">Option 2 — Renewing your certificate in the panel (before it's expired)</span></h3>
<p>To renew a Sectigo certificate (before it's expired) by clicking the <strong>Renew Certificate Now</strong> button in the panel.</p>

<p>This must be an email on your domain. Make sure one of the emails listed in that dropdown has been created on your domain and you are able to receive mail with it.

<p>Please note that the process to verify your domain using email is a last resort. This means you may never receive a confirmation email and the SSL will process correctly. However, it's possible you will receive an email if other DCV steps fail to verify. So it's still important to configure this email address. View the following article for further details:</p>

<h2>Using the auto-renewal feature</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost auto-renews your Sectigo certificate as long as the following criteria are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've enabled <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215202667-Making-a-payment#autopay" target="_self">AutoPay</a>.</li>
<li>Your domain is hosted with DreamHost (i.e., the domain is listed in the panel and has its DNS pointed to DreamHost).</li>
</ul>
<p>To verify if your domain is set up for auto-renewal, navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page and click the <strong>Settings</strong> button to the right of your domain:</p>

<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-ssl-sectigo-auto-renewal.png" alt="SSL auto renewal" width="196" height="138" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Auto Renewal is enabled by default. To disable Auto Renewal, click the <strong>Turn Off Auto Renewal</strong> button.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Even if your certificate is set to auto-renew, you can renew your certificate in the panel if it's within a week of its expiration date. It won't prompt you for billing details since it knows that auto-pay is enabled. In the event that it fails the DNS validation check, this provides you with more time to manually verify the certificate.</p>
</div>
<h3>If you need to make changes to a certificate that's set to auto-renew</h3>
<p>In the event that you need to make changes to a certificate (e.g., contact details, email address, billing information), navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page and click the <strong>Settings</strong> button to the right of your domain:</p>

</dl>
<p>Click the <strong>Add New Certificate</strong> button, which opens the Sectigo certificate signup page where you can purchase a new certificate that includes your updated information.</p>
</div>
<h2>What if my Sectigo SSL certificate does not complete the renewal process?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There may be situations when your renewal does not complete, even though you renewed your Sectigo certificate in the panel. Typically this shows as 'Unknown' for the Expires value, which is usually due to a failure to respond to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360001402683-What-is-the-DCV-process-" target="_self">request email</a> sent to the Domain Control Validation (DCV) address you selected for this order.</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> respond to the email that is sent in order to successfully complete the renewal of the certificate.</p>
<p>If you did not receive the DCV email to confirm your SSL certificate order, then follow these steps to reissue a new email request:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>button to the right of the domain.</li>
<li>When the Settings page opens, click the <strong>Resend DCV</strong> button.</li>
<li>Be sure to use a valid email address to send the order confirmation to.
<dl>
<dd><em>The DCV email is sent to the address you specified. Check your email, and then respond to the request. After the DCV email is confirmed, it can take up to an hour for the SSL certificate to become active.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Renewing your certificate with another Certificate Authority</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you wish to renew the certificate with another Certificate Authority (CA), you can simply copy the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that's currently in your panel and use it to initiate the renewal process with them. You can access your CSR by following the instructions described in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089778-What-do-I-need-from-DreamHost-before-purchasing-a-third-party-SSL-certificate-">What do I need from DreamHost before purchasing a third-party SSL certificate?</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you cannot find an available Certificate Signing Request in the panel for the domain/subdomain, please see the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084098-CSR-overview">Generating or Regenerating a CSR</a> article instructions on how to replace it.</p>
