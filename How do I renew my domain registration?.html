This is different from hosting plans, which are automatically renewed. This article provides information on renewing your domains that are registered through DreamHost.</p>

<p>If a registration renewal price increases after you receive a renewal notice, DreamHost will honor the quoted rate in the notice. For example, if your quoted renewal is $9.99/year and the price then increases to $11.99/year, DreamHost will still bill you at $9.99/year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you owe something for the registration renewal, the cost is listed in the drop-down menu in the screenshot above. This charge must be paid up front for manual renewals. Auto-renewals are automatically charged to your account.</p>
