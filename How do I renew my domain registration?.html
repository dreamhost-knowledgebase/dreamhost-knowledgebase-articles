<p>By default, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registrations</a> are not automatically renewed. This is different from hosting plans, which are automatically renewed. This article provides information on renewing your domains that are registered through DreamHost.</p>

<h2><span id="How_can_I_set_up_auto-renewal">Option #1: Setting your domain to auto-renew</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can set the automatic renewal of your domain registration in your panel at <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Registrations</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Renew_Date.png" alt="Renew_Date.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>On the <span class="panel-page">Registrations</span> page, you see this column for your domain registration in the far right. In the image above, the auto-renewal option is already set since the word '<strong>YES</strong>' is in bold. Click the other links to set the other status.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>yes</strong> link sets the auto-renewal for the domain. The notices are still sent as per usual, but the notice states that the domain is automatically renewed when it is set to expire and the charge for that automatic renewal is applied to your account instead of requiring a payment for this up front.</li>
<li>The <strong>let expire</strong> link sets the domain to expire on its expiration date, but the notices for this will still be sent as per ICANN’s policy with regards to notifying the registration owner of this information.</li>
<li>The <strong>ask</strong> link sends notices to ask you if you wish to renew it. Manual renewals require payment up front when clicking the <strong>Renew!</strong> button for that domain on the <span class="panel-page">Registrations</span> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how you set up the renewal process for your domain, the notices for the domain’s expiration are still sent even if it’s set to 'let expire'. Starting 5 weeks before the domain’s expiration date, DreamHost begins sending you notices of the domain’s expiration and how you can renew it if you wish to do so.</p>

<p>The image above shows the renewal is processed for free as it’s showing a $0.00 price. Clicking the <strong>Renew!</strong> button renews the domain within 30 minutes.</p>

<p>You can click the drop-down menu to renew the domain for multiple years. However, DreamHost only allows up to a 2-year renewal for any domain name.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>If a registration renewal price increases after you receive a renewal notice, DreamHost will honor the quoted rate in the notice. For example, if your quoted renewal is $9.99/year and the price then increases to $11.99/year, DreamHost will still bill you at $9.99/year.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you owe something for the registration renewal, the cost is listed in the drop-down menu in the screenshot above. This charge must be paid up front for manual renewals. Auto-renewals are automatically charged to your account.</p>
