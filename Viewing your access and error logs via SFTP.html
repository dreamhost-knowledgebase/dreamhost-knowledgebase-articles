<p>For troubleshooting purposes, you may sometimes need to check your site’s error logs and access logs to get more information as to why a problem may occur. This article explains how to view these logs using SFTP.</p>
<p>If you'd like to view and examine these files via SSH, view the following articles instead:</p>

<li>Logs are rotated every night so that access.log and error.log only contain today’s logs, while error.log.0 and access.log.0 contain logs from the day before.</li>
<li>Log files are deleted shortly after this, so it’s recommended to check them as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Per&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/principles-gdpr_en" target="_self" rel="undefined">GDPR</a>, DreamHost stores HTTP logs by default for 3 days.</li>

<p>You must use a fully functional FTP client such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filezilla</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyberduck</a> to view your logs.</p>
</div>
<p>As mentioned previously, the logs are inside the <span class="text-object">/logs/example.com/http(s) </span>directory under your username on the server.</p>
<p>To view the logs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your user is an SFTP or Shell user. Visit the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access">Creating a user with Shell (SSH) access</a> article for instructions.</li>
