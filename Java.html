<h3><span id="Java_applets">Java applets</span></h3>
<p>Yes. <a class="new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet" title="W:Java applet (page does not exist)">Java applets</a> are applications that run on the user's browser, as opposed to CGI programs, which run on the server.</p>
<h3><span id="JavaScript">JavaScript</span></h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>"Java" and "JavaScript" are two entirely different things.</p>
<p>Java is software that runs on the server.</p>
<p>JavaScript on the other hand, is software that is stored on the server, but runs on your computer in your web browser. JavaScript has grown in the last few years and is now also being used server-side. Most notably with <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217185397-Node-js-overview">Node.js</a>.</p>

<p>This is not supported on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared hosting</a> plan.

<p>While certainly a useful technology, as time goes on it will be more and more difficult to integrate it with other technologies DreamHost operates on.</p>
<p>DreamHost has closely evaluated the most obvious alternative (Jakarta Tomcat), but due to an inherent limitation in the way Tomcat was designed, it is not a feasible alternative when used in a shared hosting environment. A number of commercial solutions have also been evaluated, but none have been found to be a viable, cost-effective replacement that will work on all shared hosting servers.</p>
