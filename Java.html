<h2><span id="What_version.3F">What version of Java does DreamHost use?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can run the following command to obtain the current version of Java on your server:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">java -version</span>
openjdk version "1.8.0_312"<br />OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_312-8u312-b07-0ubuntu1~18.04-b07)<br />OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.312-b07, mixed mode)
</pre>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Your server's installed version of Java may have a slightly different build number on certain hosting platforms, such as older Dedicated and VPS plans.</p>

<h2><span id="Which_Java_features_does_DreamHost_support.3F">Which Java features does DreamHost support?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost supports the following Java features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java (in general)</li>
<li>Java Applets</li>
<li>Java2</li>
<li>Java SDK/JRE (Software Dev Kit/Java Runtime Environment)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Java_applets">Java applets</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java applets</a> are supported on DreamHost servers. They are applications that run on the user's browser, as opposed to CGI programs, which run on the server.</p>
<h3><span id="JavaScript">JavaScript</span></h3>
<p>JavaScript is supported on DreamHost servers. Please note that "Java" and "JavaScript" are two entirely different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java is software that runs on the server.</li>
<li>JavaScript on the other hand, is software that is stored on the server, but runs on your computer in your web browser. JavaScript has grown in the last few years and is now also being used server-side, most notably with <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217185397-Node-js-overview">Node.js</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="Which_Java_features_does_DreamHost_NOT_support.3F">Which Java features does DreamHost NOT support?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost does NOT support the following Java features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jakarta servlets</li>
<li>JSP</li>
<li>Jakarta EE</li>
<li>Jakarta Enterprise Beans</li>
<li>Tomcat (a JSP engine)</li>
<li>Pretty much anything else Java-related.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Java_servlets">Jakarta servlets</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Jakarta servlets</a> are not supported on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared Hosting</a> plan. However, you may enable this on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> (if root/sudo is not required) or a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> Server.</p>
<p>While certainly a useful technology, as time goes on it will be more and more difficult to integrate it with other technologies DreamHost operates on.</p>
<p>DreamHost has closely evaluated the most obvious alternative (Apache Tomcat), but due to an inherent limitation in the way Tomcat was designed, it is not a feasible alternative when used in a shared hosting environment. A number of commercial solutions have also been evaluated, but none have been found to be a viable, cost-effective replacement that will work on all Shared Hosting servers.</p>
