<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article provides details on how to quickly and safely remove an application installed via the One-Click installer in the panel.</p>
</div><h2>What is removed on the server?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you remove a One-Click install, several files could be deleted depending on where the install is located. Make sure to read through the examples below before removing your One-Click Install:</p>
<h3>If your install is in the primary web directory</h3>
<p>The primary web directory of your site is the directory the server looks for to serve files. View the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">How to add a domain</a>' article. Step #4 shows where the web directory is located. You can also visit the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.installer&amp;" target="_blank">One-Click Installs</a> page.</p>
<p>Click '<strong>Manage Installed Applications</strong>'.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="" class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-07_panel_oneclicks_manage_apps_button.png"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>Next click your website name. It will show a forward slash next to the One-Click icon.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-07_panel_oneclicks_remove_01.png"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>In general, this directory is the name of your website. For example, if your site is named 'example.com', your web directory would be '/home/username/example.com' also. This means that when you visit your site at 'example.com', you're seeing the One-Click Install.</p>
<p>If this is where you've installed your One-Click, <strong>be very careful</strong> when deleting it in the panel. If you delete the One-Click stored in your primary web directory, <strong>ALL FILES</strong> in the web directory and all sub-directories are deleted. This means that if you have any subdirectories like 'example.com<strong>/images</strong>' or 'example.com<strong>/blog</strong>', those are also deleted.</p>
<p>Make sure to only use this option if you want <strong>everything</strong> deleted from your website and server including all other files under this web directory. If you need any of those files or sub-directories, make sure to back them up before removing the One-Click</p>

</ul>
<h3>If your install is in a sub-directory</h3>
<p>If your install is in a sub-directory such as 'example.com/<strong>blog</strong>, only the files within that sub-directory are deleted.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-07_panel_oneclicks_remove_02.png"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>For example, if your site was 'example.com/blog', only files within that /blog sub-directory are removed. However, the empty /blog directory will remain. No files are touched above this directory, so anything within the /example.com directory remains.</p>
