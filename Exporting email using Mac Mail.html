<p>This article explains how to export (download/backup) your email using MacMail 11.5 to your computer.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HDQM6P6ET0CBD3STXHM8P8ZA">Exporting your email</h2>
<p>You'll need to connect your address to the mail server you wish to download email from.</p>
<p>This means that if you're backing up email from your old hosting company, you'll need to use their email settings to connect to their mail servers.</p>
<p>If you're connecting to a DreamHost address, use the following article instead:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add your address to Mac Mail.

<li>In the left pane, select all of the folders you'd like to backup. Hold down the 'command' button to select multiple folders. In the image above, the Inbox for <span class="text-object">user@dreamhostexample.com</span> is selected, along with the <span class="text-object">folder1</span> and <span class="text-object">sub1</span> folders.

</dl>
</li>
<li>In the navigation windows, choose where you would like to backup these emails. This example backs them up to a folder titled <strong>MacMail_Backup</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Choose</strong> button to select this folder. This downloads your email to your computer.

</dl>
</li>
<li>On your computer, navigate to the folder you used to backup these emails.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see in this folder an 'INBOX' folder which contains sub-folders with an mbox extension. For example, below the 'INBOX' folder is the 'INBOX.mbox' folder. Within these folders is the actual <span class="text-object">mbox</span> file that contains your email. Every folder will have its own <span class="text-object">mbox</span> file.</p>
