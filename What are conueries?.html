<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>"Conueries" is a term DreamHost came up with to measure MySQL database usage. The word is a combination of "connections" and "queries", as that is what the unit is derived from. Basically, the number of MySQL queries you have in a month, plus 25 times the number of connections you have is your total "conueries" for a month.</p>
<p>You can access your MySQL usage page at the following link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.mysql&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL Usage</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are no hard limits on conueries. DreamHost still tracks them, but unless you're in the top .01% of database users, you'll never need to worry about them again. DreamHost reserves the right to have ultra-heavy users curtail their database usage or switch to a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> server. However this would only be an issue with an extremely inefficient site receiving thousands of visitors a day.</p>
