<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>By default, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registrations</a> are not automatically renewed. This is different from hosting plans, which are automatically renewed.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The following domains are known as 'Auto-Renew Only' domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>.AT</li>
<li>.DE</li>
<li>.JP</li>
</ul>
<p>If you own one of these domains, view the following article:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>There are two options to renew a domain that is registered through DreamHost: either setting your domain to auto-renew or manually renewing a domain. The following provides information on both options as well as some common FAQs that you may have when renewing a domain.</p>
</div>
<div id="How_can_I_set_up_auto-renewal" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Option #1: Setting your domain to auto-renew</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can set the automatic renewal of your domain registration in your panel on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Registrations</a> page.&nbsp;To the far right is the <span class="text-object">Auto Renew Setting</span> column.</p>
<p>If it is set to <span class="text-object">YES</span>, it is configured to renew automatically.</p>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Click the other links to set the other status.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="text-link">yes</span> link sets the auto-renewal for the domain. The notices are still sent as per usual, but the notice states that the domain is automatically renewed when it is set to expire and the charge for that automatic renewal is applied to your account instead of requiring a payment for this up front.</li>
<li>The <span class="text-link">let expire</span> link sets the domain to expire on its expiration date, but the notices for this will still be sent as per ICANN’s policy with regards to notifying the registration owner of this information.</li>
<li>The <span class="text-link">ask</span> link sends notices to ask you if you wish to renew it. Manual renewals require payment up front when clicking the <strong>Renew Now</strong>&nbsp;button for that domain on the <span class="panel-page">Manage Registrations</span> page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how you set up the renewal process for your domain, the notices for the domain’s expiration are still sent even if it’s set to <span class="text-object">Let Expire</span>. Starting 5 weeks before the domain’s expiration date, DreamHost begins sending you notices of the domain’s expiration and how you can renew it if you wish to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You can click the drop-down menu to renew the domain for multiple years. However, DreamHost only allows up to a 2-year renewal for any domain name.</p>
</div>

</div>
<h2>Option #2: Manually renewing a domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If your DreamHost panel access is restricted due to a past-due amount or account suspension, you must <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.payment" target="_self">resolve</a> any outstanding account balance or suspension before you can purchase, renew, or transfer-in a domain registration.</p>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>It's currently not possible to renew multiple domains at once.</p>
</div>
<p>To manually renew your domain name:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Registrations</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Renew Now</strong>&nbsp;button to the right of the domain name you wish to renew.
<dl>
<dd><em>The <span class="text-section">Order Summary</span> page appears, which displays the domain and the renewal price:</em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The renewal price may show as $0.00. You still must continue this process to renew the domain registration.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Renew Domain Now</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your domain will begin the renewal process and typically completes within 30 minutes. A <span class="text-object">Pending renewal</span> message appears next to the renewing domain when you return to the <span class="panel-page">Manage Registrations</span> page.</p>
<h3>Paying for the domain</h3>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If a registration renewal price increases after you receive a renewal notice, DreamHost will honor the quoted rate in the notice. For example, if the quoted renewal is $9.99/year and the price then increases to $11.99/year, DreamHost will still bill you at $9.99/year.</p>
</div>
<p>If you owe an amount for the registration renewal, the cost is listed in the drop-down menu in the screenshot above. This charge must be paid up front for manual renewals. Auto-renewals are automatically charged to your account.</p>
