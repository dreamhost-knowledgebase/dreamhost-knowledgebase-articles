<p>After creating your DreamPress site, your site is configured in the DreamPress panel. Your site is automatically set up with the following usernames and password.</p>
<ul>
<li>FTP user/pass&nbsp;— You use these credentials to log into your web server to edit your files</li>
<li>Admin dashboard user/pass&nbsp;— You use these credentials to log into your WordPress dashboard to build your site</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the Admin username and password is not emailed to you. You have two options to log into your WordPress admin dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Manage WordPress</strong> button in the DreamPress panel to automatically log in</li>
<li>Reset the password so you can log in directly at your website (<strong>example.com/wp-login.php</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This article explains how to reset your password so you can log in directly at your website.</p>
