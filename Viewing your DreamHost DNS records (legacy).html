<h2>Viewing your DNS records in the panel</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can review all of the DNS records that are set up for any site you host at DreamHost on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Cloud_dns_setup_for_a_domain_dns_link.png"></dd>
</dl>
<p>Under the domain name, click on the <span class="text-link">DNS</span> link:</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_domains_dns_records_01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The details for each column consist of the DNS record set up for your domain:</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="#F2F2F2">Record</th>
<th bgcolor="#F2F2F2">Type</th>
<th bgcolor="#F2F2F2">Value</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width:25%">
<ul>
<li>Shows the service for this record.</li>
<li>For example, if you have a record for the ‘www’ service, the ‘www’ name will be listed under this column.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style="width:25%">
<ul>
<li>Shows the record type.</li>
<li>For the ‘www’ hosting service, you will see ‘A’ here as it would be set up as an ‘A’ record for that service.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style="width:25%">
<ul>
<li>Shows the value for that record. You will see a different value here depending on the type of record that’s set up</li>
<li>For the ‘www’ record, this column will show an IP address to point the ‘www’ record to so that it’s hosted with DreamHost.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This information is very handy if your domain points to non-DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> and you need to configure any or all of these records manually to point to DreamHost services.</p>
<p>If you are using DreamHost hosting services (including parking or a redirect of the site), and your domain is registered with DreamHost, you should use these name servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the nameservers are pointing to DreamHost, the records on your domain’s DNS page will be applied to your domain.</p>
