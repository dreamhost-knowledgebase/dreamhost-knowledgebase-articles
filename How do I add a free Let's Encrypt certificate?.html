<h2>Before adding the certificate</h2>
<p>Before you begin to add the certificate, make sure the DNS of your domain is already pointing to DreamHost. This means that either your Nameservers should be pointed to DreamHost, or your A records (www and non-www record) should be pointed to your domain's IP address (assuming your Nameservers are at a different company).</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215414867#A_record">How to add an A record</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is because 'Let's Encrypt' adds a .well_known/ folder to your site to authenticate the certificate. If your site's DNS is not resolving to DreamHost, the certificate cannot create this folder and authenticate. View the following sections to check your DNS values:</p>
<h3>Checking where your nameservers are pointed</h3>
<p>View the following link to check where your nameservers are pointed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467#checking-nameservers">Where are my nameservers pointed?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If they are already pointed to DreamHost, you do not need to change anything.</p>
<p>If they are NOT pointed to DreamHost, you'll need to either point them, or change your domain's two A records.</p>
<h3>Updating your domain's A records</h3>
<p>As explained above, if your nameservers are not pointed to DreamHost and you do not wish to change them, the other option is to update your domain's two A records.</p>
<p>You'll need to update the www A record, and the non-www A record. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>www.example.com</li>
<li>example.com</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you're pointing a subdomain such as blog.example.com, you'll still need to create the www record. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>www.blog.example.com</li>
<li>blog.example.com</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>These must be updated at the company where your nameservers are pointed. View the following article for instructions on how to find the correct IP address to point them to:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>htaccess rules</h3>
<p>Additionally, certain .htaccess rules such as IP blocking, rewrite rules, and password protection may cause the installation to fail. To play it safe, rename your .htaccess file (to something like .htaccess_OFF) in order to turn it off temporarily. Then, install the certificate. Once installed, you can rename the file back to .htaccess.</p>
<p>If disabling your .htaccess breaks your site, then add the following rule which should allow the installation to process:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteRule ^.well-known/(.*)$ - [L]
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Adding the certificate</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Secure Hosting'</a>) page. The top section titled 'Active SSL certificates' lists any active SSL certificates for your domains.
<dl>
<dd><em>The next section titled 'Add a new SSL certificate' lists three options to add an SSL to your domain:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/SSL_panel_01.png" alt="SSL panel 01.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>'Add'</strong> button next to Let's Encrypt SSL.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/SSL_panel_05.png" alt="SSL panel 05.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>From the dropdown, choose your domain and if you wish to purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> address.
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>In order for a domain/subdomain to show in the dropdown menu, it must be set as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">'Fully Hosted</a>', '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416417-Mirror-domain-overview">Mirrored</a>', or 'Parked'.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>Then click the <strong>'Add now!'</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>A Success message displays confirming the purchased certificate:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl></dl>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Test if the SSL certificate is working</h2>
<p>The certificate is now installed on your domain. Visit the secure URL of your website at:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://</strong>example.com</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" alt="Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see the browser bar shows a lock icon confirming the connection is secure.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you just installed the certificate, you may need to wait a few hours for it to update online.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS be default</h2>
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in 'https' before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (https).</p>

<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Redirecting to the HTTPS version of your URL only works for the same domain. This means that you can only redirect from <strong>http://example.com</strong> to <strong>https://example.com</strong>. </p>
<p>Is it NOT possible to redirect to a different domain. For example: <strong>http://example1.com</strong> to <strong>https://example2.com </strong>would not function with a 'Let's Encrypt' certificate.</p>
