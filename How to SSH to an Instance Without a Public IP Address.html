<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If you have private networking enabled in DreamCompute, you may use it to expose some servers to the internet while limiting access to others on the private network. For example, you may want your web server exposed on port 80 or 443 while keeping your database access restricted to only the private network. One complication of this configuration is how to access your private instances without a floating IP address. The answer to that is to use a jump host.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-it-works">
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>A jump (or bastion) host acts as a middleman for all traffic to your non-public instances and is easy to set up using SSH and its configuration options. The first thing you want to do is to make sure you have an instance running with a floating IP address. This could be any DreamCompute instance with a floating IP, but you’d typically use a dedicated jump host or your web server in the example above. Ensure you can SSH into that machine with your SSH key. If you need instructions for that, check out <a class="reference external" href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214843617-How-to-upload-an-SSH-key-via-the-DreamCompute-dashboard">how to upload SSH keys in DreamCompute</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuring a Jump Host in DreamCompute</h2>
<p>The following example shows a setup of an SSH config file (~/.ssh/config) on a local machine so that it can connect first to a jump host called “jump”. Change $username to the default user for your image,</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Instances created before October 5th, 2016 will continue to have “dhc-user” as the default user, except for CoreOS, which will have “core” as the default user.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ubuntu: ubuntu</li>
<li>Fedora: fedora</li>
<li>Debian: debian</li>
<li>CentOS: centos</li>
<li>CoreOS: core</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p class="first">Enter the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="code highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre>Host jump
HostName X.X.X.X #Replace with your Floating IP Address
User $username
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Replace “X.X.X.X” with the floating IP address for your instance in the HostName option.</li>
<li>Be sure you’re using the correct public key.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Ensure you can log into your jump host with SSH:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">[user@localhost]$</span> ssh jump
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Once you verify that it works, update the SSH config to send all traffic from your machine to the private DreamCompute network through a proxy on the jump host by entering the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="code highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre>Host 10.10.10.*
ProxyCommand ssh jump -W %h:%p
User $username
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/dreamcompute.pem
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>This example uses a separate key for private instances rather than the jump host, which allows you to keep both keys on your machine - the jump host doesn’t need the private key for the other instances. This provides an extra level of security.</li>
<li>The -W option forwards all stdin and stdout to the specified host and port.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">To connect to your private instances from a local machine, SSH to the private IP:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">[user@localhost]$</span> ssh 10.10.10.5
</pre>
</div>
