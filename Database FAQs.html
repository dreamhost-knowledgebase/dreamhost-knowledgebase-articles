<h2><span id="How_do_I_create_a_database.3F">How do I create a database?</span></h2>
<p>Databases can be created in the DreamHost panel only. Databases cannot be created via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>. View the following article for further details:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Is_there_a_limit_to_how_many_databases_I_can_create.3F">Is there a limit to how many databases I can create?</span></h2>
<p>There is no limit and you can create as many databases as you would like for any hosting service.</p>
<h2><span id="Do_you_provide_long_term_backups_for_my_databases.3F">Do you provide long term backups for my databases?</span></h2>
<p>Long term backups for databases are not available. DreamHost only provides 5 days worth of database backups and these are not guaranteed. It’s highly recommended to continually backup your databases locally.</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_I_backup_my_databases_myself.3F">How can I backup my databases myself?</span></h2>
<p>Backing up databases can be done via Shell or phpmyadmin. Instructions can be found in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215039758-How-do-I-backup-my-database-">How do I backup my MySQL database?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="My_domain_is_no_longer_pointed_to_your_DNS_or_it_has_expired._How_can_I_backup_my_database.3F">My domain is no longer pointed to your DNS or it has expired. How can I backup my database?</span></h2>
<p>If you have a Shell user, you can log into your web server via SSH and perform a mysqldump. Once you’ve completed the backup, you can log into your web server via FTP to download the backup file.</p>
<h2><span id="How_do_I_import_my_database_backup.3F">How do I import my database backup?</span></h2>
<p>You can do this with a Shell user via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214395638-phpMyAdmin-overview">phpMyAdmin</a>. View the following article for details:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Can_I_use_my_FTP_user_to_access_a_database.3F">Can I use my FTP user to access a database?</span></h2>
<p>No. Domain users such as Shell, SFTP, and FTP are isolated from your database users. Additionally, database access is only available on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview">Dedicated</a> server.</p>
<h2><span id="What_available_services_do_you_have_for_databases.3F">What available services do you have for databases?</span></h2>
<p>All hosting services come with a shared MySQL server. You also have the option to upgrade to a private database server in your panel. View the following article for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">MySQL VPS overview</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Do_I_have_root.2Fsudo_access_to_this_MySQL_VPS_server.3F">Do I have root/sudo access to this MySQL VPS server?</span></h2>
<p>No. The MySQL VPS is still a managed service so access to the server is unavailable. Only on a Dedicated server would you have access since the databases are hosted locally on that same machine.</p>
<h2><span id="Where_can_I_view_the_MySQL_logs.3F">Where can I view the MySQL logs?</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately logs are not available for shared MySQL. However, if you have upgraded to a MySQL VPS, support can retrieve the logs for you. Just submit a support ticket in your panel requesting this.</p>

<h2><span id="Why_is_my_database_hostname_not_working.3F">Why is my database hostname not working?</span></h2>
<p>Several factors can cause this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain is not pointed to DreamHost’s <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a></li>
<li>The domain is not <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">fully hosted</a> in the panel</li>
<li>The <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215864877-What-if-my-domain-registration-expires-">domain registration has expired</a></li>
<li>You’ve enabled <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215769578-Passenger-overview">Passenger</a>, or are using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216431827-Nginx-overview">Nginx</a> instead of Apache.</li>

Why am I not able to access the database via phpMyAdmin?</span></h2>
<p>There is a DNS A record for the actual database hostname in addition to the site’s A records. Just like the domain, you must add that A record as well for the database hostname to work. View the DNS article for details.</p>
<h2><span id="Can_I_update_the_MySQL_version.3F">Can I update the MySQL version?</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2><span id="Do_database_users_have_all_privileges_on_the_database.3F">Do database users have all privileges on the database?</span></h2>
<p>Not all privileges are available. View the following article for a current list:</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Can_I_provide_limited_access_to_other_users_to_my_database.3F">Can I provide limited access to other users to my database?</span></h2>
<p>Yes. You can create multiple users to access the database and set their privileges. View the following article for details:</p>
