<p>With a Shared, VPS, or DreamPress hosting plan, all MySQL databases are on a separate MySQL machine. On a Dedicated server, all MySQL databases are stored locally on the same machine. This gives you full root access to modify your MySQL databases as you need.</p>
<h2>Managing your database</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203272308-Managing-Databases">manage your databases</a> in the DreamHost panel just like any other hosting plan. If you are an advanced user with knowledge of the UNIX Shell and would like to perform customizations beyond what the panel can offer, you must use a Shell user to log into the server. View the following category for articles on how to create a Shell user and log into your server.</p>
