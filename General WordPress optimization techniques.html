<p>Over time, you may notice that your WordPress site runs slower or doesn't run as well as it should. There are several reasons this can occur.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following article describes some of the best potential solutions to address issues that commonly lead to slow or inefficient websites.</span></p>
</div>
<h2>Caching</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Using a caching plugin</h3>
<p>Caching creates static versions of your site, which means a lot less has to be processed by the server when a customer visits your site. This allows your site to load a bit faster, and also helps manage larger amounts of traffic. There are a few ways to set up caching for WordPress with plugins, which are described on the following page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214586538-WordPress-caching-options">WordPress caching options</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>PHP Cache (OPcache)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OPcache is a caching engine built into PHP. When enabled, you’ll enjoy significant website speed improvements automatically.</span></p>
<p><strong>Does my hosting plan support OPcache?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is enabled by default on Shared and DreamPress hosting plans, so if you're already using one of those plans, you </span><strong>do not</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to enable it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are on a VPS, Dedicated, or DreamCompute Hosting plan, follow the instructions in the following article to enable it manually.</span></p>

<h2>How to Optimize your database</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Using the WP-DBManager plugin</h3>
<p>You should routinely optimize your MySQL database to avoid a "fragmentation" effect. The easiest&nbsp;way to do this is to use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dbmanager/">WP-DBManager</a> plugin which includes a function to optimize your database as well as the ability to schedule this optimization to run at a desired time (recommended once per month at least).</p>
<p>Once installed, click 'Database' in the left pane:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/WP-DBManager.png" alt="WP-DBManager" width="754" height="754" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Under 'Database', click 'Optimize DB' and then click the <strong>Optimize</strong> button.</p>
<h3>Using wp-cli</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on using wp-cli to optimize your database:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Using SSH to optimize your database</h3>
<p>See the following article for details on how to optimize the database via SSH:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215036388#Optimizing_via_SSH">Optimizing your database using SSH</a></li>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Checking your theme</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Using the optimal theme can be a challenge. While the available themes on wordpress.org are free and safe to use, some are better than others. When shopping for a theme, be sure to search Google to determine if any users have complained about site speed with that theme. These results can greatly help you determine which theme is best for you.</p>
<p>A quick way to check if your theme is causing issues with your site is to revert back to the default theme (such as TwentySeventeen) and see if that resolves any issues with your site.</p>
<p>To change the default theme:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your WordPress site's panel.</li>
<li>On the left pane, click 'Appearance &gt; Themes'.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/WP_activate_theme.png" alt="WP_activate_theme" width="542" height="542" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Search for the default 'TwentySeventeen' theme, and then click the <strong>Activate</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your site changes its appearance to the TwentySeventeen theme. Use the online tools above to check if this improves your site's performance.</p>
</div>
<h2>Determining which pages receive the most visitors</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every DreamHost website stores access.log information about the site. These logs can become very large and difficult to read, so there are a few commands you can run to quickly tell which site is receiving the most traffic. See the following article for further information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216105097-Viewing-and-examining-your-access-log-via-SSH">Viewing and examining your access log via SSH</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Upgrading to DreamPress or a VPS</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you've tested the various plugins and suggestions as described in this article and still seeing a high load on the server, then it could be that the traffic to your site has outgrown Shared Hosting. If this is the case, you can consider adding a <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/" target="_self" rel="undefined">VPS</a> or <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/wordpress/managed-wp-hosting/" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamPress</a> to your hosting package.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about adding DreamPress or a VPS to your account, please <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact DreamHost support</a> for more info.</p>
</div>
<h2>Are there any missing files in my WordPress installation?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your WordPress installation may be missing certain key files. This can result in 404 errors and can cause a server to work harder than normal as it tries to find them. This results in considerably slower load times, especially on popular websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common missing files is the favicon (<span class="text-object">favicon.ico</span>) file. DreamHost automatically generates a blank favicon for all domains by default, but if you notice it's missing, you can easily create a new one.</span></p>
<p>Adding a favicon if one doesn't already exist is simple to do. You can add one using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> client, or by logging into your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>. Once logged in, create a blank file in the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-website-directory" target="_self">root of your website's directory</a>. This example assumes it's in the <span class="text-object">/home/username/example.com</span> directory.</p>
<p>If you're creating it via SSH, run the following commands after logging in. Make sure to change <span class="text-object">username</span> to your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access" target="_self">Shell user</a>.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cd /home/<span class="code-highlight">username</span>/<span class="code-highlight">example.com</span></span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">touch favicon.ico</span></pre>
</div>
<p>This command creates a blank <span class="text-object">favicon.ico</span> file. A blank icon is far better than one that is missing since your server will not work harder looking for it.</p>
<p>To check for any other missing files, you can run your site through <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">Pingdom Tools</a>. A single pass through the site shows you any missing files that can cause your site to load slowly. Simply look for filenames in red and then either replace them or remove references to them in your themes or posts.</p>
</div>
<h2>Other common issues for poor performance</h2>
