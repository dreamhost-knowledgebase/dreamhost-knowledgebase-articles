<p>Beginning in September 2017, DreamHost is rolling out upgrades for Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (aka Trusty Tahr).</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>You will be contacted via email in advance, <em>and also</em> when the upgrade for the server begins. Notices will also be visible in the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi">DreamHost Control Panel</a>.</p>
<p>Your site, and any services you are using on your web server, will not be reachable for brief periods during the time of the upgrade. This will NOT affect MySQL, Cloud, or email services.</p>
<h2>Known Changes</h2>
<p>DreamHost's Ruby environment is changing. The following describes the major version changes and how to make adjustments to your server.</p>
<h3>Gems and Bundler</h3>
<p>In order to provide the best possible experience and modernize support for Ruby, DreamHost is no longer maintaining system gems. You must use <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115001070131-Using-Bundler-to-install-Ruby-gems">Bundler</a> (if you haven't done so already) to install any gems you may need.</p>
<h3>Version Upgrade</h3>
<p>The Ruby version on the server is changing from 1.8.7 to 1.9.3. If you would like more control over this, DreamHost strongly recommends using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217185247-Ruby-Version-Manager-RVM-">RVM</a>.</p>
<h2>How can I find support?</h2>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;">contact support</a>.</p>
