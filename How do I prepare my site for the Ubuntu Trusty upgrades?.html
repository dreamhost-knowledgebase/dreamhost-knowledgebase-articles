<p>Beginning in September 2017, DreamHost is rolling out upgrades for Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (aka Trusty Tahr).</p>
<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>You will be contacted via email in advance, <em>and also</em> when the upgrade for the server begins. Notices will also be visible in the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi">DreamHost Control Panel</a>.</p>
<p>The times of the upgrades can vary from server to server, however, the upgrades are timed to ensure there are several highly trained engineers on hand should any major issues arise.</p>
<p>Your site, and any services you are using on your web server, will not be reachable for brief periods during the time of the upgrade. This will NOT affect MySQL, Cloud, or email services.</p>
<h2>VPS upgrades</h2>
<p>The upgrade will be done in two phases (which means two separate periods of unavailability for your VPS and all services hosted on it):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Phase one</strong>: <strong>The host machine upgrade</strong> — This should not take longer than an hour, and will cause your VPS to be inaccessible until it completes. </li>
<li>
<strong>Phase two</strong>: <strong>Your VPS's upgrade</strong> — After the host machine has finished updating, DreamHost will begin sequentially upgrading each individual VPS until all are running Ubuntu Trusty. This may take up to 25 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read through the "New changes" section below for system changes that may impact your website.</p>
<h2>DreamPress host machine upgrades</h2>
<p>At this time, DreamHost is only upgrading the host machine on which your DreamPress server runs (not your individual DreamPress server). The operating system on your VPS or DreamPress server will not change, nor will there be any major changes to your hosting environment. This only affects the host machine that they run on. The upgrade will take about one hour to complete, during which time your DreamPress website will be unavailable.</p>
<p>DreamHost will notify you at a later date when your individual VPS or DreamPress server is going to be upgraded.</p>
<h2>New changes</h2>
<h3>Gems and Bundler</h3>
<p>DreamHost's Ruby environment is changing. The following describes the major version changes and how to make adjustments to your server.</p>
<p>In order to provide the best possible experience and modernize support for Ruby, DreamHost is no longer maintaining system gems. You must use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001070131-Using-Bundler-to-install-Ruby-gems">Bundler</a> (if you haven't done so already) to install any gems you may need.</p>
<h3>Ruby version change (from 1.8.7 to 1.9.3)</h3>
<p>The Ruby version on the server is changing to 1.9.3. If you would like more control over this, DreamHost strongly recommends using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217185247-Ruby-Version-Manager-RVM-">RVM</a>.</p>
<h3>Perl version change (from 5.14.2 to 5.18.2)</h3>
<p>Ubuntu Trusty includes a new version of Perl, 5.18.2.</p>

<h3>Django version change to 1.6.11</h3>
<p>If you previously installed your version of Django using the old django-setup.py install script, you could potentially see errors with your website. Unfortunately, technical support is unable to assist with any older installation errors.</p>
<p>The only recommended way to currently install Django is in a virtualenv.</p>
