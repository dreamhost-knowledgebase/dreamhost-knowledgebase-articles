<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you originally <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting">add a domain to your panel as Fully Hosted</a>, you must assign it a username. This is the username on the server assigned to the domain. It's also the same username you use to log into your account via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>At some point, you may need to assign a new user. This article describes how to move a domain to a new user.</p>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>Before you assign a domain to a user, you should consider what type of use it may need. This could be either an SFTP or Shell user. The following article explains more about the differences between these two user types:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you have already created several website users, you can use the following article instructions to filter them by their type (SFTP or Shell). This helps to quickly choose which user you'd like to move the domain to:</p>

<h2>Changing your domain's username</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=domain.dashboard#!/list-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage</strong> button to open the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043889332-The-Manage-Websites-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="panel-page">Manage Websites</span></a> page, which allows you to adjust various settings for your site.
<ul>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001294366#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">Grid view</a>, click the <strong>Manage</strong> button at the bottom of the website box.</li>
<li>If in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001294366#grid_or_list" target="_self" rel="undefined">List view</a>, click the&nbsp;<strong>Manage</strong> button at the far right of your domain name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Login Info</strong> button under <span class="text-section">Manage Your Site</span>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Switch user</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the user you want to control this domain from the dropdown.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>After selecting the new user, a toggle titled <span class="text-object">Move files to the new user?</span>&nbsp;appears. If you keep this checked, all files under the current user are copied to the new user. In most cases, this is what you want. The only reason to UN-check that option is if you want a new user without any existing files on the domain.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Save Changes </strong>button to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you chose to copy files to the new user, it may take some time depending on how much data there is to move.</p>
