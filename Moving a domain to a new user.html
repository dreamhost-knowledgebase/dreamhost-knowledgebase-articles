<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you originally <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting">add a domain to your panel as Fully Hosted</a>, you must assign it a username. This is the username on the server assigned to the domain. It's also the same username you use to log into your account via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>At some point, you may need to assign a new user. This article describes how to move a domain to a new user.</p>

<h2>Changing your domain's username</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li> Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosted Domains</a> page.</li>
<li>To the right of your domain, click the <span class="text-link">Edit</span> link.</li>
<li>Under the section <span class="text-section">Users, Files, and Paths</span>, click the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select the username you want to control this domain. 
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>After selecting the new user, a checkbox appears titled <span class="text-object">Move files to the new user?</span>. If you keep this checked, all files under the current user are copied to the new user. Most likely this is what you want. The only reason to UN-check that option is if you want the new user to start clean with nothing in the domain.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>Scroll down and click the <strong>Change settings</strong> button to save.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you chose to copy files to the new user, it may take some time depending on how much data there is to move.</p>
