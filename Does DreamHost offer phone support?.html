<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Support is mainly provided via email and Live Chat. However, DreamHost does have an option whereby customers can request a callback from technical support.</p>
<p>By default, callbacks are not included with any standard hosting package. You can, however, add three callbacks per month to your account for a nominal monthly fee. Support also offers a one-time callback feature for a fee as well.</p>
<p>The pricing options for callbacks are listed below and can also be found under the <span class="text-object">Uses</span> dropdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>One-time only</strong> – $9.95</li>
<li>
<strong>Three callbacks every month</strong> – $14.95/month</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Calls may be recorded for quality assurance purposes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>What hours are callbacks available?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Callbacks are available at all hours and can be scheduled from the next hour or later. Callbacks get prioritized in our queue. </p>
