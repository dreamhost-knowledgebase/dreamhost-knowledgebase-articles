<h3>About Pathping</h3>
<p>Windows also has a command you can run called 'pathping'. This tool is useful as it basically combines <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840708-Traceroute">Traceroute</a> and ping together. Pathping runs the same as ping syntax – simply run 'pathping' instead of just 'ping'.</p>

<p>Pathping takes much longer to complete than running these two commands separately.</p>

<p>Ping along with <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840708-Traceroute">Traceroute</a> are helpful tools to assist you in determining the cause of connection problems. If these tools fail, comparing results between your site and a reliable site (such as Google) can be extremely valuable in determining whether the problem is your computer, your ISP, or your site.</p>
<h2>Using Mac OSX and Linux</h2>
<p>The procedure is slightly different for Apple Mac OSX and Linux: namely, these operating systems continue to ping until you tell it to stop. Instead, use the following command which tells it to ping only ten times:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ping -c 10</span>
</pre>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215360828-SSH-client-software">Mac SSH</a> article to open your terminal.</li>
<li>Run the following command:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ping -c 10 dreamhost.com</span>
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
