<p>If you are opening a new account, a credit card must be used to initially open it. This is to prevent fraudulent accounts from being opened. After the initial payment is received and the account is approved, you may make subsequent payments using any of the accepted payment methods listed below in this article.</p>

<p>If you are purchasing any items that require payment up front (such as a new domain registration or renewal) payment must be made via credit card only. This is because the payment will go through instantaneously and the request can be sent to the registry immediately for you. You can also make a pre-payment with PayPal by following the instructions at:</p>

<p>Some international or prepaid credit cards, even if they have a Visa/MasterCard logo on them, may not be accepted due to limitations set by their own financial institutions.</p>
