<h2>Up front payments</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are purchasing any items that require payment up front (such as a new domain registration or renewal), payment must be made via credit card only. This is because the payment processes immediately and the request is then automatically sent to the registry for you. You can also make a pre-payment with PayPal by following the instructions at:</p>
