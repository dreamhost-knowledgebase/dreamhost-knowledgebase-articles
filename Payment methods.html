<p>If you are purchasing any items that require payment up front (such as a new domain registration or renewal) payment must be made via credit card only. This is because the payment will go through instantaneously and the request can be sent to the registry immediately for you. You can also make a pre-payment with PayPal by following the instructions at:</p>

<p>Some international or prepaid credit cards, even if they have a Visa/MasterCard logo on them, may not be accepted due to limitations set by their own financial institutions.</p>
