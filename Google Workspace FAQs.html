<h2>Do I need a DreamHost hosting plan for Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No, you do not need a hosting plan in order to have Google Workspace, but you do need a domain name to associate with your Google Workspace license. During Google Workspace signup, DreamHost asks you to select from a list of the domains in your DreamHost account.</p>

<h2>Can I have multiple email addresses with Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. With Google Workspace, you can create up to 30 standard email aliases for each user, or unlimited “disposable” aliases (<span class="text-object">name+alias@example.com</span>). You may also create additional Google Workspace mailboxes by purchasing additional user licenses for your account.</span></p>

<h2>Can I migrate my existing email to Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Google Workspace has a built-in data migration to import your team’s email, contacts, and calendars. View the following article for further details:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a large number of users, Google recommends using their data migration service to migrate your user's mail, contacts, and calendars to Google Workspace. The setup is simple, and most mail server connections can be made automatically. This feature is available under </span><strong>Data migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Google Workspace admin console.

<h2>What do my MX settings need to be for Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If DreamHost is managing your DNS (you are using DreamHost's nameservers), this will be configured automatically.</p>
<p>If you are using a third party to manage your DNS (meaning you are not using DreamHost's nameservers), you will need to configure that with your DNS provider.</p>

<h2>Can I use a Discussion List if I'm using Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes.&nbsp;You don't have to use DreamHost's email service to use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001263566-What-is-a-Discussion-List-" target="_self">Discussion List</a>. This is because the Discussion list is created on a subdomain such as <span class="text-object">@lists.example.com</span>. This means the email is originating from DreamHost and not your Google Workspace account.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="comparisons" class="header-section">Comparisons</h2>
<h2>How is Google Workspace different from a normal @gmail.com address?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>An address ending in <span class="text-object">@gmail.com</span> is a free personal email address that has no connection to your website. When you have an <span class="text-object">@gmail.com</span> address you also have access to Google Drive which comes with apps such as Storage, Online Document Editing, and Video meetings, but these are applications that are related only to your personal Google account. These have no relation to your website.</p>
<p>Google Workspace is configured for your domain name. This means it will end with something like <span class="text-object">@example.com</span>. It comes with all the basic apps that a personal Google account does in addition to several other tools you can use to manage your website. You can create several email addresses on your domain (<span class="text-object">admin@example.com</span>, <span class="text-object">contact@example.com</span>,&nbsp;<span class="text-object">hello@example.com</span>, etc..)&nbsp;&nbsp;within this account since it's an account for the domain. It also comes with an administrative console to make managing your website data very simple.</p>
</div>
<h2>How is Google Workspace different from DreamHost email?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Google Workspace email addresses and DreamHost email addresses are both set up on your domain. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">admin@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">contact@example.com</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">user@example.com</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is that Google Workspace comes with several apps from Google to manage your website data. These include email, online document editing, video chats, and more. DreamHost email does not offer these Google services.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="header-section">Payment</h2>
<h2>Why would I want to pay for Google Workspace when Google offers similar products for free?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Paid Google Workspace plans provide you with several features and integrations not available in the free consumer version of the apps. With Google Workspace, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>custom business email addresses <span class="text-object">@example.com</span></li>

<h2>Why would I want to pay for Google Workspace when DreamHost already includes email service with my hosting plan?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<h2 class="header-section">Domain registration</h2>
<h2>Is a domain registration included in the price of Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The cost of a domain is separate from the price of Google Workspace.&nbsp;Domain registration fees can vary widely depending on the extension (.com, .net, .org, etc.) and you may prefer to add Google Workspace to a domain you already own.</p>
<p>During Google Workspace signup at DreamHost, you can specify the domain you would like associated to your Google Workspace account. View the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview" target="_self">Domain registration overview</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Will email still work if my domain registration expires?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email service will only work with a valid domain registration and up-to-date </span><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MX records</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;DreamHost verifies this for you during Google Workspace setup. Email messages sent to an address at an expired domain would bounce back to the sender with a notification that the message was undelivered.</span></p>
</div>
<h2 class="header-section">Plans</h2>
<h2>What are the differences between Google Workspace Basic and Google Workspace Business edition?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost offers two editions of Google Workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google Workspace Business includes all the features of Basic, plus more storage, enhanced search, and archiving. View the following article for further details.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Can I combine 'Basic' and 'Business' edition users under one domain on Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Workspace uses a site-license, where all users within a domain must be of the same type — either all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Workspace Basic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Workspace Business</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you add users, they are automatically created as your current license type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Google Workspace’s flexible monthly billing, you may upgrade/downgrade your domain’s Google Workspace plan at any time, and your bill will be adjusted accordingly. There are no fees for modifying your Google Workspace subscription, aside from the cost of the plan itself. </span></p>

<h2 class="header-section">Add-ons</h2>
<h2>Can I purchase individual Google Workspace apps?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. When you sign up for Google Workspace, you’ll gain access to a set of integrated apps (excluding Google Voice)&nbsp; that work together seamlessly. For instance, you can receive a message in Gmail and instantly convert it into a Calendar event. When you make a comment in Docs, Sheets, or Slides, collaborators automatically receive email alerts. With a single click, you can launch a Hangouts video meeting from your inbox or calendar.</p>
<p>Using these tools together improves productivity and gives your business the most value. However, you are welcome to purchase the suite and only use the services of your choice.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can I add Google Workspace users later?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. You may add or remove users to your Google Workspace account any time.&nbsp;Google Workspace from DreamHost uses flexible monthly billing, where your bill automatically adjusts to the user count selected in your DreamHost panel.</span></p>
<p>During the initial setup, you will set up your first user, who is also your Admin User.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">To add more users, simply log in to your Google Workspace admin homepage, where you’ll find a link to add individual users or upload a <span class="text-object">.CSV</span> file to bulk-assign new users.</span></p>
</div>
<h2>Is Google Voice available with Google Workspace?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Google Voice is not available if you purchased your Google Workspace subscription through DreamHost. If you require Google Voice, you must purchase a Google Workspace subscription directly through Google.</p>
