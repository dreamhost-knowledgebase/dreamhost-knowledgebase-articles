<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article lists common errors you may see on your website along with troubleshooting solutions to resolve the issues you're seeing.</p>
<p>In a shared hosting environment, there are many issues that can affect the performance of your site. They can range from problems with your database, compromised code, misconfigurations in your site, and hitting memory limits which causes your processes to be killed.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, these problems can often cause each other. For example, a compromised site could slow down the database with junk data, causing it to take more time and memory to load, which then causes the user of the site to hit memory limits.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPKPBVQG9ENP5K3BAAS">Immediate 500 Internal Server Error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two things that can potentially cause this to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> issues</li>
<li>Hitting shared server memory limits</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HSM6KHPKH5BZZ65QGBNZT2SA">.htaccess issues</h3>
<p>If the error happens instantaneously, then most likely, the cause is something to do with your site's <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file. Some potential things to look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax errors in the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file</li>
<li>Custom PHP setup that isn't working</li>
</ul>
<p>To see if this is the cause, try renaming the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file in your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-website-directory" target="_self">site's home directory</a> to something like <span class="text-object">.htaccess.disabled</span>. If the problem is in your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file, that will immediately solve the problem.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> rules apply to all subdirectories – so it's possible for an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file outside of your site's web directory to affect your site. Make sure you also look higher up in the directory structure for <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> files that might affect things, and try renaming any you find in order to see if it helps.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HSM6KHPKFHJHZ03JJ5YNCYYM">Hitting memory limits</h3>
<p>If that doesn’t solve the problem, you may be having processes killed due to exceeding your user's memory limit. One quick way to see if this might be affecting you is to simply check to see which processes you have running as your user. The following articles list several tools you can use to investigate your running processes and memory usage:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPKR7EX50BK7EZZQA6Y">Site spins trying to load for a while and then displays a 500 Internal Server Error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This can be caused by a few different things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hitting memory limits as described above</li>
<li>PHP timing out</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HSM6KHPKSV6C7M7YBTCDNVG6">PHP timing out</h3>
<p>If this only happens on specific&nbsp;pages (in particular admin pages for the software you're using), then it's very likely that this could be the cause. You can find out if this is the cause by creating a custom <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">phprc</a> for your site and adjusting the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028776572-Increase-the-PHP-execution-time">max_execution_time</a> setting.</p>
<p>If this happens to all of your pages, then it can still potentially be a PHP timeout. You can check your site <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216512197-Viewing-your-access-and-error-logs-via-SFTP">error logs</a> to see if there are any helpful error messages. If all you see is a "Premature end of headers" error, there isn't much information to troubleshoot with, as this simply means the script exited before completing.</p>
<p>You can read more about creating a custom <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file in the following article:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPK5592VQ4MM86KNKE0">Site tries to load then displays a 522 connection timed out error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The <span class="text-object">522 connection timed-out</span> error only appears on Cloudflare-enabled domains when Cloudflare times out contacting the origin web server. See the following article for information on how to troubleshoot a 522 error:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPK16JY9WT74KPMD2CE">Site spins while loading forever</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This is perhaps the most generic thing that can happen with your site. Most often, this means that something is causing your PHP processes to hang. If you run the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000683852-Using-the-top-command-to-troubleshoot-your-website"><span class="code">top -c</span></a> command on the server, you might notice <span class="code">&lt;defunct&gt;</span> showing up next to some of those processes as well. This can be caused by a large number of things.</p>
<p>With WordPress, this often has to do with database tables having overhead. That shouldn't cause problems, but for some reason WordPress can get itself into a bad state if there is any overhead (particularly in the <span class="text-object">wp_options</span> table) and it will oftentimes exhibit this symptom in those cases. Other major causes of this are software misconfigurations or third-party addons to the software you're using that have a compatibility issue or poor coding.</p>
<p>You can read more about reducing overhead and optimizing WordPress in the following articles:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPKQMW5R02RE5F0JX1N">Site loads immediately, but only a blank page displays</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This issue is most often related to either a WordPress theme that's being used having problems or a caching plugin behaving improperly. Depending upon what exactly is going on this one can be a little tricky to solve and will likely require some fiddling to get things working properly again.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPKHXRZMKN4J0GCQMRP">Site loads immediately, but displays a database connection error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>View the following article for information on how to troubleshoot a database connection error:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPK60M916E55Z70BSRF">Site loads immediately, but displays a 403 Forbidden Error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The 403 Forbidden error is displayed when a deny rule is set for an IP in a site's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess file</a> or when file permissions keep the web server from serving up a page. You can usually get an idea of the issue causing this by looking at your <span class="text-object">error.log</span> file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216512197-Viewing-your-access-and-error-logs-via-SFTP">Viewing your access and error logs via SFTP</a></li>

</ul>
<p>In most cases, this is file-permission related. To check permissions for your site:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate into your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory#the-users-home-directory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user's home directory</a>.</li>
<li>Get a directory listing by running the <span class="code">ls -la</span> command:</li>
</ol>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ls -la</span>
<span class="cmdoutput">drwxr-x--x   16 username pg123456    4096 Nov 21 07:30 .
...</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The first line should look like the above. Notice the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214751018-UNIX-commands-Changing-permissions">permission string</a> that reads "drwxr-x--x". The first letter stands for "directory", then there are three sets of three permissions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first set is the owner permissions which are set to read/write/execute.</li>
<li>The second set is the group permissions which are set to read/execute.</li>
<li>The third set is "other" permissions (or what all other users have), which are set to execute only.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have Enhanced Security enabled for your user, it would look like this instead:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ls -la</span>
<span class="cmdoutput">drwxr-x---   16 username adm    4096 Nov 21 07:30 .
...</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The above are the correct permission settings. If, instead, they look like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">drw-r-----   16 <span class="cmdoutput">username </span>pg123456    <span class="cmdoutput">4096 Nov 21 07:30 .</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>or this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">d---------   16 <span class="cmdoutput">username </span>pg123456    <span class="cmdoutput">4096 Nov 21 07:30 .</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Then that means your user has been disabled and you should contact DreamHost. If this is the case, you'll likely see errors like this when attempting to log in and won't be able to get the directory listing as described above:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Could not chdir to home directory /home/username: Permission denied
-bash: /home/username/.bash_profile: Permission denied
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you see this, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact DreamHost support</a> for assistance.</p>
<p>If permissions look fine, but you're still getting a 403 error, then try renaming the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217738987-What-can-I-do-with-an-htaccess-file-">.htaccess file</a> for your affected domain from <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> to <span class="text-object">.htaccess.disabled</span> like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv .htaccess .htaccess.disabled</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Then, try loading up your site. If the 403 error is gone, then open up your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file and look for lines starting with <span class="code">deny</span>. If you find any, comment them out by putting a <span class="code">#</span> before the line and saving the file. You can re-enable the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file you disabled above like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv .htaccess.disabled .htaccess</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you see the site directory has an addition to the end of its directory saying that it was disabled by DreamHost, check your email for a notice from support concerning why. If you cannot find one, write in for support immediately.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HSM6KHPKTSMJ2RZ3WFB2B8KE">Site loads, but displays a 404 Error rather than what you expected</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This happens most often with sites that use software such as WordPress that use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217738987-What-can-I-do-with-an-htaccess-file-">.htaccess rules</a> for their permalinks/pretty URLs. If those rules are removed or changed somehow then a 404 will appear rather than the content you expect.</p>
<p>The easiest way to fix this is to download a fresh copy of the software you're using from its website (e.g., <a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/" rel="nofollow">https://downloads.joomla.org/</a>) and then copy the contents of the default <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file and paste it into your existing one (keep in mind that <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> files are invisible files, so you might need to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-to-view-hidden-files-in-an-FTP-client">enable viewing of invisible files</a> in your FTP client to find the file if it's there).</p>
<p>Not all software comes with an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file by default. For instance, WordPress generates one when you change your permalink settings, so keep that in mind as well. If putting in the default <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> rules doesn't resolve the 404 issue, write in to support and request additional help.</p>
<p>For WordPress specifically, this can often be fixed by just resaving your permalink structure. To do this, log into your admin panel, go to <span class="text-section">Settings &gt; Permalinks</span>., and then click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button.</p>
