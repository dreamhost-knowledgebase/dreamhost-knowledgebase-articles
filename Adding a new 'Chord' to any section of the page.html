<p>Clicking on this button reveals a list of all built-in components (about us, contact, embedded video, etc.) you can add to the page.</p>
<p>When you've located the component you wish to add, click it. It's automatically added to the page. You can then move that section up or down the page by <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005607548-Editing-the-page-structure-in-Remixer">editing the page structure</a>.</p>
<h2>Find a specific type of component</h2>
<p>When you click the 'New' button you can then specify which type of component you're looking for. For example, if you want to add a video, click the 'video' link.</p>
