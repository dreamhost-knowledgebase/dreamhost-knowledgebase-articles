<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every installation of PHP comes with default settings which are usually fine for most websites. Occasionally, the needs of a website makes it necessary to adjust these PHP settings. For example, your site may need to increase the memory limit to allow a process to complete. In that case, you would need to create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini (phprc)</a> file and update this value.</p>
</div>
<h2>The DreamHost phprc file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The standard term for a PHP configuration file is <span class="text-object">php.ini</span>. However, DreamHost uses the term <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file instead. This acts the same way â€“ only the name is different. In this article, only the term phprc is used.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Some variables (in particular, <span class="code">memory_limit</span>, <span class="code">post_max_size</span> and <span class="code">upload_max_filesize</span>) are subject to internal limitations; increasing them significantly beyond the default values will not work correctly and will cause issues with your site.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Why increase the PHP memory limit?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>PHP allows a default amount of memory to be used when processing a website. Sometimes, a website needs more than the default amount of memory. If that's the case, you can increase it to fit the needs of your site.</p>
<p>You may also receive an error on your site indicating that the memory limit has been reached. It may appear like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 94371840 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 5072 bytes)</pre>
</div>
<p>This error means your site needs more memory than is currently available. If you see an error like this, try increasing your memory limit by 10MB. Then continue to adjust as necessary.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Increasing_the_PHP_memory_limit">Increasing the PHP memory limit</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The default memory limit is 256M and this is usually more than sufficient for most needs. If you need to raise this limit, you must create a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.&nbsp;View the following articles for instructions on how to create a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.</p>

<p>If the file already exists, view the following articles for instructions on how to update it (depending on if you're using an FTP client or SSH):</p>

</ul>
<p>If you wish to increase this limit, add the following line:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">memory_limit = 300M</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you find you're increasing the memory a large amount, it's time to consider moving off of Shared Hosting, as your website has greater needs than Shared Hosting can reliably provide.</p>

<h2>Extra step for WordPress sites</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're running a WordPress site, the setting in your <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file may not take affect since WordPress is overriding it in your <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> file. To fix this, just update your <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> file with the specific memory limit. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your WordPress site via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure you're in your site's directory. You'll see your <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> file here.</li>
<li>Edit this file (using <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP">FTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">SSH</a>) to add the following lines. Make sure to add these before the 'wp-settings.php' inclusion. For example:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '300M' );
define( 'WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT', '300M' );

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Kill off all running php processes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">kill running php processes</a> to ensure your new settings take effect.</p>
</div>
<h2>Confirming your changes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, you should check to confirm the values have updated. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-Viewing-your-site-s-PHP-version-and-settings">phpinfo.php file</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">My phprc file isn't updating</a></li>
