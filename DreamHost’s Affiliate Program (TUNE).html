<p>The Tracking Links section is where you can customize your tracking link and you can simply use the provided link to start referring. There are additional parameters that you can pass to track how your conversions are doing. The following describes each one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Source</strong> — a non-unique parameter that can be used to track the source of the link. This is commonly used to track where the link is placed. It can be up to 255 standard alphanumeric characters.</li>
<li><strong>Add Creative</strong> — used to add a creative file to the link. This includes banners that can be used to promote DreamHost.</li>
<li><strong>SubIDs</strong> — non-unique parameters that can be used to add additional metrics to a conversion. SubIDs are often used to note specific conversions for optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Click ID</strong> — a unique identifier that can be used to track specific individual clicks or sessions in other tracking systems.</li>
<li><strong>Unique ID</strong> — similar to click IDs, these are additional unique identifiers that can track specific clicks or sessions in other tracking systems.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Link</strong> — if you are interested in deep linking, please reach out to our support team for more information.</li>

<p>The Offer Details section shows the details of your current offer. The expiration date is always pushed back. Limited offers may be available at a future date during limited-time promotions and will have a hard expiration date.</p>
<h3>Payout</h3>

</div>
<h2 id="h_01F8XJ7P38PFH5V6853JCNZ33B"><span id="offers">Additional Offers</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Additional Offers and promotional discounts are not available to new affiliates. While DreamHost has different tiered payout structures, these are reserved for affiliates who have brought in a consistent and considerable amount of conversions. If you feel that you have brought in a decent amount of conversions, send an email to <a href="mailto:affiliates@dreamhost.com">affiliates@dreamhost.com</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="97-day">97-day holding period</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Earned rewards are available for redemption after the 97-day holding period, provided that the affiliate has chosen to cash out their rewards. For affiliates who have an earnings balance in excess of $20, earned rewards are paid out via PayPal on the first business day after the 10th of the month. Rewards payments are subject to a 5% PayPal processing fee.</p>
<p>In the event of possible credit card fraud or high cancellation rates during the 97-day holding period, DreamHost reserves the right to hold the rewards for up to two (2) additional months for verification. At DreamHost's sole discretion, it reserves the right to cancel rewards in the event of any the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost is unable to collect funds from the referred customer.</li>
<li>The order is fraudulent.</li>
<li>The customer cancels within the first 97 days.</li>
<li>The reward was earned improperly for any other reason.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="disclosure">Disclosure</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Affiliate links come under the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines of endorsements. Additionally, DreamHost affiliates are required to clearly disclose on their website that they are earning commissions for their reviews or the traffic coming to DreamHost from their site. Failure to do so may result in removal from DreamHost's affiliate program and cancellation of commissions in addition to being penalized by the FTC.</p>
<p>Disclosures must appear on any page that has a review, recommendation, comment, or article that promotes a product or service for which you receive compensation. You cannot claim that you do not receive compensation if you accept payment through an affiliate program.</p>
<p>Do not use vague or obscure language in your disclosure: it must be immediately apparent that you may collect compensation for your review or rating.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Disclosure</strong>: This blog contains DreamHost affiliate links. This means I may earn a commission if you purchase DreamHost services through my link without any extra cost to you. This commission helps me keep the site running. Thank you for your support!</li>
<li><strong>Unclear Disclosure</strong>: Websites need $$$ to operate. We may receive compensation for your purchases through our link, but we are totally unbiased and do not make falsified representations for the services, claiming them to be something they’re not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about the FTC disclosure requirements <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/refer-and-earn-terms-and-conditions/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Follow these tips to make sure you’re in compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the disclosure high on the page/email/and so on.</li>
<li>Evaluate the size, color, and graphics of the disclosure in relation to the rest of the content. If someone can miss seeing it, you’re doing it wrong.</li>
<li>Account for viewing on different devices: your disclosures should be responsive and still visible/prominent on mobile.</li>
<li>Don’t bury the disclosure or distract from it with other media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your disclosure must be immediately evident to a typical visitor who views a review, ranking, or endorsement. A visitor should not need to scroll, click, or hover to learn that you receive compensation.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="responsibilities">Affiliate restrictions and responsibilities</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Please thoroughly review the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>DreamHost does not accept “coupon-only” sites in its affiliate program. DreamHost reserves the right to deactivate any account that uses coupons/discounts as a primary method of promotion at its sole discretion.</li>
<li>Double-check your affiliate link. Affiliates are responsible for ensuring that their tracking code is working correctly before sending traffic to DreamHost’s servers. Any modification to the links is the sole responsibility of the affiliate. Rewards may not be paid for tracking errors caused by editing, masking, redirecting, or tampering with affiliate links, as determined at DreamHost’s sole discretion.</li>
<li>Domain forwarding is not allowed. You may not purchase a domain and set it to forward directly to DreamHost's site using your affiliate link.</li>
<li>Remember: no copy + paste, please. Affiliates MAY NOT copy DreamHost’s website or any portions of it, including, without limitation, any of DreamHost’s trademarks or other intellectual property, and display them on their own site or subdomain or use them in any way — you need DreamHost’s prior expressed written permission for that.</li>
<li>Don’t try to be DreamHost: purchasing, either directly or indirectly, the search name “DreamHost” or any misspelling or variant thereof from websites, search engines, or other directory referral services is prohibited.</li>
<li>Skip the spam: violations of DreamHost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/anti-spam-policy/" target="_self">Anti-Spam Policy</a> or its <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/" target="_self">Terms of Service</a> will result in immediate forfeiture of all rewards payments. Additionally, you are prohibited from (1) outranking DreamHost’s internal paid search ad on any keywords, (2) direct linking to DreamHost.com from any paid search ads, and (3) using DreamHost.com as a display URL.</li>
<li>Scamming is prohibited. Gaining referrals through misrepresentation, improper use of DreamHost intellectual property (e.g., DreamHost trademarks and copyrighted material), or impersonation of DreamHost personnel is strictly prohibited and can result in loss of accrued rewards and/or removal from the program.</li>
<li>You can’t use your own link: referred accounts must use different billing and payment methods than the referrer to qualify for rewards.</li>
<li>Keep the referrals out of the family: customers cannot refer themselves or their spouse/civil union partner. No exceptions will be made. Violations can result in the loss of all accrued rewards and dismissal from the program.</li>
</ol>
<p>See DreamHost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/refer-and-earn-terms-and-conditions/">Terms and Conditions page</a> for more information.</p>
