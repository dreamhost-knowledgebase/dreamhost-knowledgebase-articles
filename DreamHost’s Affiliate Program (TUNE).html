<h2 id="h_01HXVVNQN0HZYAWK768M7H0AF8">Disclosure</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Affiliate links come under the Federal Trade Commission’s guidelines of endorsements. Additionally, DreamHost affiliates are required to clearly disclose on their website that they are earning commissions for their reviews or the traffic coming to DreamHost from their site. Failure to do so may result in removal from DreamHost's affiliate program and cancellation of commissions in addition to being penalized by the FTC.</p>
<p>Disclosures must appear on any page that has a review, recommendation, comment, or article that promotes a product or service for which you receive compensation. You cannot claim that you do not receive compensation if you accept payment through an affiliate program.</p>
<p>Do not use vague or obscure language in your disclosure: it must be immediately apparent that you may collect compensation for your review or rating.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Disclosure</strong>: This blog contains DreamHost affiliate links. This means I may earn a commission if you purchase DreamHost services through my link without any extra cost to you. This commission helps me keep the site running. Thank you for your support!</li>
<li><strong>Unclear Disclosure</strong>: Websites need $$$ to operate. We may receive compensation for your purchases through our link, but we are totally unbiased and do not make falsified representations for the services, claiming them to be something they’re not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn more about the FTC disclosure requirements <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/tune-terms-and-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Follow these tips to make sure you’re in compliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the disclosure high on the page/email/and so on.</li>
<li>Evaluate the size, color, and graphics of the disclosure in relation to the rest of the content. If someone can miss seeing it, you’re doing it wrong.</li>
<li>Account for viewing on different devices: your disclosures should be responsive and still visible/prominent on mobile.</li>
<li>Don’t bury the disclosure or distract from it with other media.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your disclosure must be immediately evident to a typical visitor who views a review, ranking, or endorsement. A visitor should not need to scroll, click, or hover to learn that you receive compensation.</p>
