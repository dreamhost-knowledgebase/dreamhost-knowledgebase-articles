<p>Cloud-Init can be used to provide a script to an instance that runs at the
instance’s creation. This tutorial will show how to deploy NGINX on an Ubuntu
Trusty instance during its creation.</p>
<p>This can be done in either the web dashboard, or using the command line.</p>
<div id="using-the-web-dashboard">
<h2>Using the Web Dashboard</h2>
<p>Open the web dashboard in a browser, then navigate to the instance tab by
clicking on Compute &gt; Instances on the left side of the browser.
Click the Launch Instance button, give
your instance a name, boot from an Ubuntu Trusty image, select the default
security group, then click the “Post Creation” Button on the far right of the
“Launch Instance” page. Here you can either upload a file to be used with
Cloud-Init or just input the contents of the file into the web UI. Copy and
paste the text below into the text box.</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#! /bin/bash
apt-get install nginx -y
</pre></div>

<div id="using-the-nova-client">
<h2>Using the Nova Client</h2>
<p>You can create an Ubuntu Trusty instance and pass it a script for cloud init to
execute at creation using the nova commandline client. First you need a file to
with the script that you want to run, we’ll call it cloud-init.sh. We want
Cloud-Init to install NGINX, so the contents of cloud-init.sh should be:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#! /bin/bash
apt-get install nginx -y
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The <cite>-y</cite> is so that it doesnt ask for user input, it just assumes yes to
any questions.</p>
</div>
<p>The command to create an instance that runs cloud-init.sh at creation is:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># nova boot --image Ubuntu-14.04 --flavor 100 --user-data cloud-init.sh</span>
</pre></div>

on how to launch an instance from the command line</p>
</div>
<div id="using-a-different-linux-distro">
<h2>Using A different Linux Distro</h2>
<p>If you wanted to deploy NGINX on a different Linux distro, the only thing that
needs to be changed is the script that Cloud-Init runs to install NGINX.
For example if you wanted to deploy NGINX on CentOS, your file would look
something like:</p>
<div class="code highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#! /bin/bash
yum -y install nginx
service nginx start
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="troubleshooting">
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>After the instance launches, you should see the NGINX welcome page when you
visit its IP in a web browser. If you do not, you should check your security
groups to see if they are blocking port 80.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-your-own-script-to-be-used-with-cloud-init">
<h2>Writing your own script to be used with Cloud-Init</h2>
<p>You can put anything in a shell script for Cloud-Init to execute while creating
your instance, although you should only run commands that don’t take user
input. Cloud-Init can be used to install packages at instance creation, but if
you want to install more than a couple things that you need to manage closely,
it is recommended you use a configuration management tool like Ansible or
Puppet as they provide more control over your system.</p>
