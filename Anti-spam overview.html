<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Spam (also known as "junk" mail) is unsolicited email or newsgroup postings often advertising a product or service. Spam sent through a network causes an additional load on the servers that process the data which could in turn cause slowness and delivery issues to the end user.</p>
<p>DreamHost makes efforts to prevent users from sending and receiving such email as it results in a variety of different problems for customers and the server.</p>
<p>Spam is sent in various ways and mail servers are always finding new ways to block them. At the same time, spammers find new ways to work around these new roadblocks to get their messages through. So, it’s an ongoing fight to minimize the effect of spam.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Phishing">Phishing</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There is another form of spam known as "phishing". Phishing is different in that it is sent in order to retrieve important information, to sell you a product, or sign you up for products/services through fraudulent means. These emails are directed specifically to you, but it is still spam.</p>

<h2><span id="How_DreamHost_responds_to_spam">How DreamHost responds to spam</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost has a very strict policy against spamming from its servers, and takes a very dim view of those who use such practices to further their business goals. If DreamHost catches someone sending spam, their account is disabled without a refund since it violates the terms of service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, stopping spam from outside of DreamHost isn't always quite as simple. There are currently actions being taken across the Internet and beyond to stop spam. For example, various pieces of legislation aim to make it illegal in some localities to send spam. Until then, DreamHost must rely on existing technologies.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="The_consequences">The consequences</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Spamming is grounds for account cancellation at DreamHost, without prior warning or refund (even on the first offense). Visit the following page for further legal details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/anti-spam-policy/">http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/anti-spam-policy/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This applies to cases where the account in question is obviously being used for the distribution of unsolicited bulk messaging. Even spamming from another service in order to promote a site hosted with DreamHost is against DreamHost’s anti-spam policy, and will be dealt with accordingly.</p>
<p>In cases where the sender's intent is unclear, or DreamHost is unable to determine if a spam complaint is with merit, the site is not deactivated until the complaint is verified.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Is_my_bulk_email_spam.3F">Is my bulk email spam?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Spam is any form of unsolicited bulk communication used to promote a website, a product, or an idea. Generally, the recipient does not welcome the spam, nor did they intentionally sign up to receive it. The most common method of distribution for spam is electronic mail, although newsgroup postings, web-based bulletin boards, and various forms of online messaging may also be conduits through which spam is sent and received.</p>
<p>Unlike opt-in mailing/distribution lists, spam does not give an opportunity for the recipient to express his or her disinterest before having already been spammed. Given the size of the Internet, it should be assumed that the vast majority of its users have no interest in the contents of your mailing, and should not be included without prior permission. So-called 'targeted' lists are still considered unsolicited (as each individual is still without choice in the matter prior to receipt of a message), and are covered within DreamHost's anti-spam policy as well.</p>

<h2><span id="Determining_if_a_complaint_is_valid">Determining if a complaint is valid</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost reserves the right to determine whether or not a spam complaint is valid. The following table describes the guidelines that assist in this goal, and may prove useful in ensuring that your own actions are protected under the terms of service:</p>

<h2><span id="How_to_prevent_cancellation">How to prevent cancellation</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The short answer to this is simple: don't spam. No policy can completely prevent spam, but DreamHost’s at least prevents it from occurring more than once. If you spam, you will lose your account.</p>
<p>The long answer is also pretty clear: make an effort to distinguish yourself from the spamming population. First, if you offer a mailing list to your customers, the only people who should be on that list are those who explicitly request (via a web based form, email, or the like) to be added to the list. You should also provide instructions for unsubscribing with every mailing, and honor all requests to be taken off of your list.</p>
<p>If you wish to post a message to a newsgroup of a promotional nature, you should ensure that the group's charter allows for such postings (some do, most don't). It is your responsibility to check with the charter of any newsgroup you post to in order to determine what is acceptable.</p>
<p>If you are careful to ensure that everyone on your distribution list chose to be there, and provide means for those who do not wish to be there to unsubscribe, you should have little to worry about. Bulk email is fine as long as it is an opt-in service.</p>

<h2><span id="Why_have_these_rules_been_implemented.3F">Why have these rules been implemented?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Please understand that while DreamHost’s anti-spam stance may seem harsh, it is for the protection of all customers and the Internet community in general. There are many opportunities to market your site effectively without resorting to such activities.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the anti-spam policy and how it may affect you, feel free to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact DreamHost</a>. The goal is to educate customers on the effects of spam, and attempt to insulate them from those negative effects as much as possible.</p>

<h2><span id="More_information_on_spam">More information on spam</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are numerous sites which go in to great detail about the spam problem, and may provide information that you can use to make yourself better prepared to fight your spam problem. Here are a few to get you started:</p>

<h2><span id="SpamCop.21">SpamCop!</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>One very useful tool is SpamCop, a website run by an anti-spam activist which makes the process of finding and reporting unsolicited commercial email much easier than before. Many times, the headers in such messages are forged by using fake or 'throwaway' email accounts. However, SpamCop usually finds a way past these tricks and helps you report the sender to the proper individuals at his/her service provider. Although you may find some administrators to be unresponsive, most respectable providers will take your complaint seriously and close down the spammer's account.</p>
<p>Although it won't help with all cases, SpamCop has proven to be effective more often than not.</p>
