<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Unfortunately, DreamHost does not offer automatic refunds for the following payment methods:</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>A 3% transaction fee is applied If you select PayPal to process a refund, which is only applied if the payment was not originally processed via PayPal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Check (written checks or electronic checks)</li>
<li>Money Orders</li>
<li>Gift Certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>If you close your shared hosting plan within 97 days of opening the account and had made a manual payment toward the plan with one of these other methods, then&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Support</a> for further assistance with your refund.</p>
<p>If your account is closed after the 97 day refund period has passed,&nbsp;no refunds are issued. View the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;page for further details.</p>
</div>
<h2>Domain registrations</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Are domain registrations refundable?</h3>
<p>No. Registrations are owned by you for the full term you originally purchased them for. This is usually a 1- to 3-year time period.</p>
<p>If your registration includes a free domain with your Shared hosting plan and you canceled the plan in the first year, you are then required to pay for the free registration. View the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528#paying-for-registration-after-canceling" target="_self">Why do I have to pay for my free domain registration when closing my account?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Can I still use my domain registration?</h3>
<p>Yes.&nbsp;If at some point you would like to have your domain point to a different web host, you will be able to log in to the&nbsp;<a href="http://panel.dreamhost.com/">DreamHost panel</a>&nbsp;and make your changes to your&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS settings</a>&nbsp;to point to the new host.</p>
<h3 class="subheader"><span id="domreg_renewal_refunds">Are domain registration renewals or transfers refundable?</span></h3>
<p>No. Once a domain is transferred, auto-renewed, or is manually renewed, your credit card is charged and the domain is renewed for one more year.</p>
<p>At this point, the domain registry updates its information to show that you are the owner for an additional year. Since there's no way to reverse the renewal from the registry, a refund is not possible.</p>
