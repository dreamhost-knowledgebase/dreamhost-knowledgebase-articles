<p>DreamHost offers a full refund on shared hosting fees if your plan is canceled within the first 97 days of opening the account. The refund is processed back to the original credit card that was used towards those fees, and is issued back to your card automatically only after you cancel your shared hosting plan within your panel.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Are_all_payment_methods_refundable.3F">Are all payment methods refundable?</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, DreamHost does not offer automatic refunds for the following payment methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>PayPal</li>
<li>Check (written checks or electronic checks)</li>
<li>Money Orders</li>
<li>Gift Certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>If you close your shared hosting plan within 97 days of opening the account and had made a manual payment toward the plan with one of these other methods, please visit the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Support’ &gt; ‘Contact Support’</a>) page to contact support to further assist you with your refund.</p>
<p>If your account is closed after the 97-day refund period has passed, you do not receive an automatic refund but instead receive a prorated credit on your DreamHost account. This can be used toward any future DreamHost service or domain registration fees.</p>
