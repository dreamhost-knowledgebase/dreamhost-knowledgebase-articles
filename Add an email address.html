<h2 id="h_01HAPY1EQ65ZVHCFC6HV971X17">Adding a new email address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A fully hosted email address has an active mailbox that you can log into to send and receive messages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=mail.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Email</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create Email</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select your domain from the Select a domain dropdown under <span class="text-section">Email Address</span>.</li>
<li>Enter the name of your new email address in the text box that appears.</li>
<li>Select <span class="text-object">Fully Hosted Email</span> under <span class="text-section">Mailbox Type</span> and click the <strong>Continue</strong> button.</li>
<li>Enter a mailbox name (this can be your name or something that describes the mailbox's purpose).</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Generate strong password</strong> button to generate a password (or enter one of your own choosing if you prefer).</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Create Email</strong> button at the bottom of the page to save the new information.

<h3 id="h_01HAPY1EQ6GE1T6261ZAJ7Y87T">How long until the email address works?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><strong>First address added to a domain</strong></p>
<p>If this is the first email created for the domain, the domain will need some time for the mail record DNS to propagate, which can take up to 6 hours for each record. During this time, messages sent to your user will be rejected with a bounce notification containing the following error:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="text-blockquote">Recipient Address Rejected</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Until the DNS resolves, the messages sent to your user will continue to be rejected. However, your user should be able to send messages even when the DNS has yet to resolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Addition address added to a domain</strong></p>
<p>If your domain is already configured with email addresses, the newly created address should be fully active within 15 minutes of it being created.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01J01ZMHDVZDDAP6RYKFES06GH">Forwarding email</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Newly created email addresses cannot forward to another inbox. They can only receive mail sent directly to them.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you previously configured an email address to forward to another inbox, this feature will remain active until the address is edited. At that point, you will need to select between forward only or fully hosted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HASCZQDWYKX4H5ZW41KEYJ4T">Logging into your email address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two ways to log into your email address.</p>
<ul>
<li>Webmail</li>
<li>Email client</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HASCZQDWPRFY69R2ZR7W27GJ">Webmail</h3>
<p>Webmail is the easiest option to log into your your email address. Visit the following link to log in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216540008-Webmail-overview" target="_self">Webmail overview</a> article for further information.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HASCZQDW4V6PA8FG0Q7SS8CN">Email client</h3>
<p>An email client (Mac Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird, iPhone, Android) offers more control over managing your email, but you must first configure it manually. The following articles guide you through the general configuration process.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HAPY1EQ66C5Y1YXF5NDGBTPN">Internet standards email addresses</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Internet standards specify that you create the following specific email addresses, which every domain should have and use for the following purposes:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Address</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>postmaster</strong>@example.com</td>
<td>Contact for any email issues. This should exist for any domain that has email service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>webmaster</strong>@example.com</td>
<td>Contact for any website issues. This should exist for any domain that has a website or <span class="text-object">http</span> service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>hostmaster</strong>@example.com</td>
<td>Contact for any DNS issues. This should exist for all domains since they all use DNS for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>abuse</strong>@example.com</td>
<td>Contact for any "inappropriate public behavior" related to the domain.</td>
