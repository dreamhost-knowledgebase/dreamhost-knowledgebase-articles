<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>You must have an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437#email_hosting">active hosting plan</a>, or a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024060072-Paid-email-plan">paid email add-on plan</a> to use email.</p>
<p>All hosting plans except Shared Starter offer email at no cost.</p>
<p>While Shared Starter hosting plans and domain registration-only accounts do not include email, you can add a paid email plan to your account that includes up to 5 email addresses. View the following article for more information:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HAPY1EQ6VFM9FR6JCXCT5SEW">Fully hosted email</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>In the past, it was possible to create a fully hosted email that was also forwarded to another inbox. This feature is no longer supported, and any new email addresses created will not have this option. Existing email addresses using this feature will remain unaffected until they are edited, at which time you will need to select between forward only or fully hosted.</p>
</div>
<p>A fully hosted email address is an address that has an active mailbox that you can log into to send and receive messages. Fully-hosted email users can access their own mailbox and use the Webmail and the Mailboxes you do not wish to access through the Webmail interface.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HAPY1EQ6GE1T6261ZAJ7Y87T">How long does a new email address take to function?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When a domain is set to be hosted, it is not set up with MX (mail hosting) records with DreamHost by default. The MX records and all other mail hosting records are applied to the domain once the first email address is created.</p>
<p>If this is the first email user created for the domain, the domain will need some time for the mail record DNS to propagate, which can take up to 6 hours for each record. During this time, messages sent to your user will be rejected with a bounce notification containing the following error:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="text-blockquote">Recipient Address Rejected</div>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Until the DNS resolves, the messages sent to your user will continue to be rejected. However, your user should be able to send messages even when the DNS has yet to resolve. This often causes confusion about why a user can send but cannot receive emails. Give the DNS a bit more time to resolve before the new user can receive incoming mail.</p>
<p>If your domain is already configured with the records for mail hosting, the newly created user should be fully active within 15 minutes of it being created.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HAPY1EQ68A0S5S16QQDW0YJV">DNS records for your new email address</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following records are configured when the first user is created:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>_domainkey (dkim)</strong></li>
<li><strong>_autodiscover (srv)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mail. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mail. (MX)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mail. (MX)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mailboxes. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.mailboxes. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>webmail. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.webmail. (A)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two MX records for the domain’s mail hosting and records for the Mailboxes and Webmail subdomains. Each record can resolve at different times, so one service may be active while another has yet to update.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HASCZQDWYKX4H5ZW41KEYJ4T">Logging into your email address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two ways to log into your email address.</p>
<ul>
<li>Webmail</li>
<li>Email client</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HASCZQDWPRFY69R2ZR7W27GJ">Webmail</h3>
<p>Webmail is the easiest option to log into your your email address. Just visit the following link to log in.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about webmail at the following link:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HASCZQDW4V6PA8FG0Q7SS8CN">Email client</h3>
<p>An email client (Mac Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird, iPhone, Android) offers more control over managing your email, but you must first configure it manually. The following articles guide you through the general configuration process.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The steps above assume your DNS is hosted with DreamHost. If you have custom <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215035328-Configuring-custom-MX-records" target="_self" rel="undefined">MX records</a> in place for a domain, you cannot create new addresses. This is because if you are using Gmail (or another alternative mail provider), you must create new email addresses at that provider.</p>
<p>Another issue to be aware of is that sometimes, when you have a large number of addresses already created, you get an error message that says:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">“Your account cannot create additional e-mail addresses at this time. 

This is usually a temporary situation and should be resolved within 24 hours.

Please contact Support if you have any questions.”

<h2 id="h_01HAPY1EQ66C5Y1YXF5NDGBTPN">Internet standards email addresses</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Internet standards specify that you create the following specific email addresses, which every domain should have and use for the following purposes:</p>

<td>Contact for any email issues. This should exist for any domain that has email service.</td>

<td>Contact for any website issues. This should exist for any domain that has a website or <span class="text-object">http</span> service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>hostmaster</strong>@example.com</td>
<td>Contact for any DNS issues. This should exist for all domains since they all use DNS for everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>abuse</strong>@example.com</td>
<td>Contact for any "inappropriate public behavior" related to the domain.</td>
