<h3>Nameservers</h3>
<p>A list of DNS servers around the world appear below along with a map. If the Nameservers ared pointed to the following records, all of your DNS records are hosted at DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Green check mark <img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/greencheck.png" /> or red X <img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/redx.png" /></h3>
<p>A green check mark confirms the DNS is updated in those locations. If you see a single red X, it most likely means there's an issue with the specific DNS server being used at that location.</p>
<p>If you see multiple red Xs, it means one of two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have not configured DNS yet at the company where your domain is registered</li>
<li>You have updated your DNS settings, but they are still propagating online</li>
</ul>
<h3>You have not configured DNS yet at the company where your domain is registered</h3>
<p>The name of your website must first be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview" target="_self">registered</a>. You can register the domain at any company you like, but that will be the company you must log into to update your Nameservers.</p>
<p>For example, if you registered the domain at DreamHost, you can configure your Nameservers in the DreamHost panel.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you registered the domain at another company, you must log into that company's panel to update your Nameservers. This article links to several articles from major hosting companies on how to do this.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>You have updated your DNS settings, but they are still propagating online</h3>
<p>If you have updated the Nameservers, it could take 24-72 hrs for them to fully update online. This is called DNS propagation. The following article explains this in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview" target="_self">DNS propagation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the DNS is updating online, you will see red Xs at the site above. They will turn green once everything has updated.</p>
