<h3 id="h_01HYC32BVNTW3TGJZATHS2KM57">Nameservers</h3>
<p>A list of DNS servers worldwide appears below, along with a map. If the Nameservers are pointed to the following records, all of your DNS records are hosted at DreamHost.</p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01HYC32BVNPVW6J9Y13A0WTCQV">Green checkmark <img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-dns-checker-check.png" width="22" height="22" /> or red X <img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-dns-checker-x.png" width="22" height="22" /></h3>
<p>A green checkmark confirms the DNS is updated in those locations. If you see a single red X, it most likely means there's an issue with the specific DNS server being used at that location.</p>
<p>If you see multiple red Xs, it means one of two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have not configured DNS yet at the company where your domain is registered.</li>
<li>You have updated your DNS settings, but they are still propagating online</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe how to fix these two issues.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYC32BVNAA3KFSRXV087N1MA">You have not configured DNS yet at the company where your domain is registered</h3>
<p>The name of your website must first be <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview" target="_self">registered</a>. You can register the domain at any company you like, but that will be the company you must log into to update your Nameservers.</p>
<p>For example, if you registered the domain at DreamHost, you can configure your Nameservers in the DreamHost panel.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you registered the domain at another company, you must log in to that company's panel to update your nameservers. This article links to several articles from major hosting companies on how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-Change-nameservers-at-your-current-host" target="_self">Change nameservers at your current host</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HYC32BVN5JEWVY087AM5Q9C6">You have updated your DNS settings, but they are still propagating online</h3>
<p>If you have updated the nameservers, it could take 24-72 hrs for them to update online fully. This is called DNS propagation. The following article explains this in more detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview" target="_self">DNS propagation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the DNS updates online, you will see red Xs in the results above. They will turn green once everything has been updated.</p>
