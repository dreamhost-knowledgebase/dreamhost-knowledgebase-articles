<p>In general, you just need to highlight the emails you wish to delete, then click the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. If you click CTRL +A, all emails in a folder are highlighted.</p>
<p>Any email you deleted is sent to a Trash folder most often named 'Trash'. Open this folder and delete any email. Here are a few links to help you depending on which email client you're using:</p>
