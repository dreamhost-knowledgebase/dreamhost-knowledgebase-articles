<p>If you are having trouble moving your website between accounts, or just don't have the time, DreamHost currently offers a Content Move service that takes care of that for you. You can find more information in the DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027686731-Website-migration-services">Website migration services</a> article.</p>

<p>The following steps describe how to manually migrate your data. This only applies if you prefer to migrate the content of your site on your own (and not use the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027686731-Website-migration-services" target="_self">DreamHost migration service</a>).</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You should be aware of a few restrictions that apply to internal domain migrations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Receiving account cannot be using an active promotion, meaning that if the account is still within the first year of hosting and signed up using a promotional discount, it's not possible to add the domain.</li>
<li>The Receiving account cannot have a referrer (this also only applies if the account is within the initial year of service).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wish to move the hosting for a domain to a new account, you must first backup all necessary files. This includes web server files, databases, and email.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> delete the domain from your panel until you have backed up all data. This may permanently delete your data.</p>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>It's not required to move the domain registration to the new account to enable hosting for the website. However, having both the hosting and registration on the same account makes it simpler to keep track of both.</p>
