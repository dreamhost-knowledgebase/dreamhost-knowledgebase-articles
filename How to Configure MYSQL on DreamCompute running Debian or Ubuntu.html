<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>MySQL is one of the most popular database engines used for websites. MySQL is an important part of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stacks as well as other AMP stacks, and is supported by many web software packages.</p>
<p>MySQL is the only relational database software offered by DreamHost for its Shared, VPS, and Dedicated hosting products. This article helps you install and configure it on a DreamCompute running Debian or Ubuntu.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installing MySQL</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Debian and Ubuntu sometimes offer multiple versions of MySQL in case your needs require an older version, however it is usually best to go with the default version if there are no specific requirements needed.</p>
<p>To install the default version of MySQL on your system, run the following commands:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get update</span>
<span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Before the installation completes, a dialog will pop up asking you to specify a MySQL server root password.</p>

<h2>Viewing installed packages</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can check which packages were just install by running the following command:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">dpkg -l | grep mysql</span>

ii  mysql-client-5.7        5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1   amd64   MySQL database client binaries
ii  mysql-client-core-5.7   5.7.21-0ubuntu0.16.04.1   amd64   MySQL database core client binaries

<h2>Configuring and using MySQL</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The configuration files are stored in the /etc/mysql directory.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">ls -1 /etc/mysql</span>
/conf.d
debian.cnf
debian-start
my.cnf
my.cnf.fallback
mysql.cnf
/mysql.conf.d</pre>
</div>
<h3>The /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf config file</h3>
<p>There are a few settings you may wish to change to customize MySQL. The following changes can be made in the /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf file.</p>
<h4><strong>Change the 'bind' address</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">Edit this file</a> and you'll see the bind address:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">bind-address   = 127.0.0.1</pre>
</div>
<p>This is the IP address MySQL is listening to. It can only listen to one IP address at any time. By default it will listen to 127.0.0.1 (aka localhost), meaning that the MySQL service will only be accessible from the instance it is installed on.</p>
<p>If you want to connect to MySQL from other DreamCompute instances, you can change this to your database <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001754711-Locating-the-IP-Address-of-your-instance">instance's IPv4 or IPv6 IP address</a>. Here is what an IPv6 configured mysql bind-address would look like:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">bind-address   = 2607:f298:6050:8a28:f816:3eff:fe62:c9c3</pre>
</div>
<h4><strong>max_allowed_packet</strong></h4>
<p>This value is the largest size allowed for a single packet, which normally is only relevant for restoring backups. If a backup was created on a server with a high setting for this value, it may have difficulty restoring on another machine with a lower setting. The default is 16M.</p>
</div>
<h2>Restarting the mysql service</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If any changes are made to your mysql configuration, you must restart MySQL for it to read the them. This can be done by running the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">sudo service mysql restart</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Connecting to the mysql shell</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you need to set up new databases or configure new users, you must log into your MySQL Shell. Run any of the following command to log in.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">mysql -u root -p</span></pre>
</div>
<p>The prompt will change to the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">mysql&gt; </span></pre>
</div>
<p>You can now run mysql commands to configure a database.</p>
</div>
<h2>Secure MySQL</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After MySQL has been installed, it's a good idea to secure its settings. Run the following command to open an interactive settings dialog:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">user@server:$ </span><span class="command">mysql_secure_installation</span>

Securing the MySQL server deployment.
Enter password for user root:</pre>
</div>
<h3>Set a value for password validation</h3>
<p>You can choose to enable the 'Password Plugin' which tests the strength of your MySQL passwords. If you want to enable this, type the letter 'y'. You can then decide how secure you'd like new passwords to be.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD plugin?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: <span class="command">y</span>

There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length &gt;= 8
MEDIUM Length &gt;= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length &gt;= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary                  file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: <span class="command">2</span></pre>
</div>
<h3>Changing your root password</h3>
<p>The dialog will ask you if you want to change your root password. This isn't necessary since you just created it while installing.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Using existing password for root.

Estimated strength of the password: 50
Change the password for root ? ((Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : <span class="command">n</span>

 ... skipping.</pre>
</div>
<h3>Disable the anonymous user</h3>
<p>It's a good idea to disable the anonymous user.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.

Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : <span class="command">y</span>
Success.</pre>
</div>
<h3>Disable root login</h3>
<p>It is also recommended to disable root login.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : <span class="command">y</span>
Success.</pre>
</div>
<h3>Remove 'test' database</h3>
<p>You should remove the 'test' database since there's no need for it.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.


Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : <span class="command">y</span>
 - Dropping test database...
Success.

 - Removing privileges on test database...
Success.</pre>
</div>
<h3>Reload</h3>
<p>Reload so your new settings take affect.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : <span class="command">y</span>
Success.

All done!</pre>
