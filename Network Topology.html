<h2>Two possible network topology views</h2>
</div>
<div id="small-view">
<h3>Small View</h3>
<div class="figure"><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/network-topology_02.png" alt="network-topology_02" width="462" height="524" /></div>
<p>This is the default view when first visiting the page. If necessary, you can also select the small view by clicking the <strong>Small</strong> button at the top left. This is a basic view of your DreamCompute setup where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Routers and instances are shown as small boxes</li>
<li>Networks are shown as labeled vertical lines</li>
<li>Connections between networks/routers and the public internet (public in this example) are shown as horizontal lines.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="normal-view">
<h3>Normal View</h3>
<div class="figure"><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/network-topology_04.png" alt="network-topology_04" width="411" height="541" /></div>
<p>You can select the normal view by clicking the <strong>Normal</strong> button at the top left. This view is similar to the small view except it shows more details, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IP addresses are displayed next to the associated routers and instances</li>
<li>The router and instance boxes are larger and now contain name (or ID) and type information. Hover over them to view more information.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Other Features</h2>
<div class="figure"><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/network-topology_05.png" alt="network-topology_05" /></div>
<p>The Network Topology page also contains buttons on the upper right which open other parts of the DreamCompute dashboard, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Launch Instance</strong> — opens the Instances page</li>
<li><strong>Create Network</strong> — opens the Networks page</li>
<li><strong>Create Router</strong> — opens the Routers page</li>
</ul>
<p>If you hover your mouse over a router or instance, you can see additional details with additional management shortcuts.</p>
