<p>The DreamHost online payment processor has a minimum amount it will accept for online payments. This minimum amount is currently $1.50 for <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215202667" target="_self">Autopay</a>, and $0.79 for <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215202667-Making-a-payment">manual payments</a>.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your due balance for the month is lower than $1.50, DreamHost simply rolls your due balance over to the next month’s invoice. Until your balance is over $1.50 on an invoice, the amount will keep deferring the balance to the next month. Once your overall monthly due balance is $1.50 or higher, you can then pay off the full balance due.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you have a balance of less than $1.50 and want to take care of that amount so you don't carry a balance, you can make a manual payment for what you owe, as long as it's at least $0.79 (which is the lowest amount that can be accepted). If you owe less than $0.79, you would still need to pay that amount and anything over the actual amount you owe will be applied to any future service fees.</p>
