<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article explains how to remove the default Non-Editable DNS records for your domain.</p>
<p>When your domain is '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Fully Hosted</a>', it has several DreamHost IP addresses (A records) assigned to it that control where the site is hosted.&nbsp;If your site's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are pointing to DreamHost and your site is 'Fully Hosted', your site is hosted on DreamHost's servers.</p>
<p>If your site's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are pointing to DreamHost but you do <strong>NOT</strong> want to host the site at DreamHost, you must remove hosting which removes these IP addresses. Setting the site to 'DNS only' removes hosting and your site's A records. You are then able to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035516812-Adding-custom-DNS-records">add custom DNS records</a> to point your site to another hosting company.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>This only works with the primary domain name such as 'example.com'. This does NOT work with subdomains like 'blog.example.com'. For subdomains, you must add custom DNS records to the primary domain as explained below.</p>

<h3>Remove secure hosting</h3>
<p>If you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">added an SSL certificate</a> to your domain, you must delete it in order for your DNS records to be removed. View the following article for instructions on how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005106528-How-to-remove-an-SSL-certificate" target="_self" rel="undefined">How to remove an SSL certificate</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What DNS records are removed?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you set a domain to 'DNS only', you remove the following DNS A records:</p>
<ul>
<li>non-www A record</li>
<li>www A record</li>
<li>ssh A record</li>
<li>ftp A record</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are a few things to note regarding these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the domain to 'DNS Only' does not delete hosted files (except on DreamPress plans) nor does it remove any <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035516812-Adding-custom-DNS-records" target="_self">Custom DNS records</a> you've previously set up. You can set the domain to ‘Fully Hosted’ again to recreate your DNS records for the domain.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that this only affects your web hosting service and leaves other things services like email intact (this assumes you already have an active hosting plan on your account).&nbsp;If you have removed your hosting plan but want to continue hosting email with DreamHost, you can purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024060072-Paid-email-plan" target="_self">Paid email plan</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, these changes are only possible for the primary domain – subdomains cannot be set to DNS Only.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If this is your only domain on your account and you're setting it to DNS only, you do <strong>NOT</strong> need a hosting plan. A hosting plan is only necessary if you wish to host a domain and its content on DreamHost servers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>What&nbsp;to do after the DNS records are removed?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After the domain is set to 'DNS Only', you can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035516812-Adding-custom-DNS-records">add custom DNS records</a> to point your site to wherever you like.</p>
</div>
<h2>Adding hosting to a 'DNS Only' domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you want to host a 'DNS Only' domain again, click the <strong>Manage</strong> button for your domain on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=domain.dashboard#!/list-view">Manage Websites</a> page. You can then select hosting options for the domain on the subsequent page.</p>
