<p>This article shows how to open an account with a hosting plan. This means you will pay for a server to host your website on. If you only want to buy the web site name (domain name), and are not ready to host the site on the Internet, view the following article instead:</p>

<h2>Step 1 — Choose a hosting plan</h2>
<p>DreamHost offers several hosting plans for you to host your website on. View the following link for a list of plans:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/">Hosting Plans</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to host a WordPress site, view the following page instead that lists all WordPress hosting options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/wordpress/">WordPress Hosting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you've decided on the plan, click the 'Sing Up' button under it to proceed with account creation.</p>
<h2>Step 2 — Create a new account</h2>
<p>After you've selected a plan you can proceed with creating your account. The steps are generally the same for all hosting plans, however examples of DreamPress and Shared hosting are shown below for clarity.</p>
<h3>Adding a DreamPress hosting account</h3>
<ol>
<li>When you've decided on the plan you'd like to purchase, click the button under it to proceed. After clicking the button, you're taken to signup.dreamhost.com. In this example it opens https://signup.dreamhost.com/dreampress/email/.
