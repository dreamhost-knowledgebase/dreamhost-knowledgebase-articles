<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamCompute instances are created with a specified SSH key which is used for gaining initial access. This guide covers some basic steps to attempt to retrieve the data, and gain access again if desired.</p>
</div>
<h2>Things to keep in mind</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>IP addresses will change</strong></p>
<p>To get back into an instance requires re-creating it. The new instance receives new IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Know your instance type</strong></p>
<p>One can generally find out if an instance&nbsp;uses an ephemeral or volume boot disk by looking at the 'Instances' page of the dashboard&nbsp;and seeing if the name of a&nbsp;custom image or&nbsp;an operating system is listed in the <span class="text-object">Image Name</span> column. If one is listed, the instance is ephemeral. If one isn't, it&nbsp;uses a volume boot disk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Regain access to ephemeral instance</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Navigate to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://iad2.dreamcompute.com/project/instances/">Instances page</a>&nbsp;of the DreamCompute dashboard.</li>
<li>To the right of the instance, click the <strong>Create Snapshot</strong>&nbsp;button and give the snapshot a name. This creates an operating system image of your running instance. Please wait for this process to&nbsp;complete before moving on to the next step (generally it doesn't take more than a few minutes).</li>
<li>Make note of the flavor of the instance, the name of the instance, and any other features that should be retained in the new instance.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215912848-How-to-launch-an-instance-using-the-DreamCompute-dashboard">create a new instance</a>.&nbsp;On the <span class="text-object">Source</span> tab, set <span class="text-object">Select Boot Source</span> to <span class="text-object">Instance Snapshot</span> and click the up arrow symbol next to&nbsp;the name of the snapshot created in the previous step.&nbsp;Please note that you cannot create a new volume from instance snapshots in DreamCompute, so make sure to set <span class="text-object">Create New Volume</span> to <span class="text-object">No</span>.</li>
<li>On the <span class="text-object">Key Pair</span> tab, select the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001736691-How-to-create-a-Key-pair-overview">Key Pair to be used for the default user</a>. If there are no valid keys available,&nbsp;you can use the <strong>Create Key Pair</strong> or <strong>Import Key Pair</strong> buttons to associate a new key pair with your project (and this instance). When you're done customizing the instance, click&nbsp;the <strong>Launch</strong> button on the bottom right.</li>
<li>Once the new instance has booted, attempt to log into it with the&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/228377408-How-to-find-the-default-user-of-an-image">default username</a>&nbsp;and the new <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001754711-Locating-the-IP-Address-of-your-instance">IP address</a>.</li>
<li>If&nbsp;everything&nbsp;looks correct and access has been restored, the original instance can now be deleted.</li>
