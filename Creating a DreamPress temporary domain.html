<p>This article describes how to create a temporary DreamPress domain at DreamHost for your WordPress site hosted at another company.</p>
<p>Most often, you won't change your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> at the other hosting company until your DreamPress site is completely configured first at DreamHost. Otherwise, your site will go down when you update the DNS.</p>
<p>You can now use a 'dream.press' subdomain to create your site at DreamHost. Then when you're ready, you can easily switch your DNS to DreamHost to have it hosted on DreamPress.</p>
<h2>Why use a dream.press subdomain?</h2>
<p>Creating a dream.press subdomain allows you to migrate your entire website to DreamHost and ensure it's functioning properly first. You can then <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">update the DNS to point to DreamHost</a>, which avoids any downtime when changing your DNS.</p>
<h2>Creating a dream.press subdomain</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the button to add a new DreamPress site. </li>
<li>Add a temporary dream.press domain. For example, create a site called <strong>example.dream.press</strong> if your current site is example.com. You can name it anything, but it must end with <strong>dream.press</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose an annual or monthly payment plan.</li>
<li>Select your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215298557-How-much-does-DreamPress-cost-">DreamPress plan: 'Basic', 'Plus', or 'Advanced'</a>.</li>
<li>Select your disk size.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add New DreamPress</strong>.

</dl>
</li>
<li>A confirmation displays. You'll soon receive further email instructions.</li>
<li>The (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page shows the domain as 'Pending' while it's being configured. You must wait until the setup is complete and 'Pending' no longer displays.</li>
<li>Once the temp domain is set up on DreamPress, you can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300607-How-do-I-migrate-a-NON-One-Click-Install-to-DreamPress-">migrate your site</a> content from your current hosting company to this new domain at DreamHost. You can also <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300597-Importing-an-existing-One-Click-Install-into-DreamPress">import an existing One-Click WordPress</a> site into this temp DreamPress site.</li>
<li>After you've migrated all site content, test the example.dream.press site to confirm it works as intended.</li>
<li>If you're migrating from another hosting company, add your current site (example.com) to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) page as '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215414867-How-do-I-add-custom-DNS-records-">DNS Only</a>'. <strong>DO NOT</strong> add hosting for your real domain. If you do, you will not be able to migrate your temp site.</li>
<li>When you're ready, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004353927-Changing-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain-to-your-live-site">change your temporary domain to your live site</a>.</li>
