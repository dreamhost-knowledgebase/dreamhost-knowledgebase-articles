<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you have a WordPress site hosted at another provider, you won't change your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> at the other hosting company until your DreamPress site is completely configured at DreamHost. Otherwise, your site will go down when you update the DNS.</p>
<p>To help you test your site before switching DNS, you can now use a 'dream.press' subdomain to create your site at DreamHost. Then when you're ready, you can easily switch your DNS to DreamHost to have it hosted on DreamPress.</p>
<p>The following describes how to create a temporary DreamPress domain at DreamHost for your WordPress site hosted at another company.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why use a dream.press subdomain?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Creating a dream.press subdomain allows you to migrate your entire website and ensure it's functioning properly before you make it live at DreamHost . You can then <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DreamHost-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">update the DNS to point to DreamHost</a>, which avoids any downtime when changing your DNS.</p>
