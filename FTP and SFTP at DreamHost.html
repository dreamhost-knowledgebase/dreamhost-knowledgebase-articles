<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>FTP and SFTP are both network protocols used to upload files from your local computer to your web server. This allows apps such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FileZilla</a> and <a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyberduck</a> to upload your website to DreamHost so it appears online.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01J18B809YV2FT9VEP2S0KC7BG">FTP</h3>
<p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is an old network protocol that transfers files between your computer and the web server. The problem with FTP is that the data is <strong>not</strong> encrypted during transfer, making it insecure.</p>
<ul>
<li>For this reason, FTP should <span class="wysiwyg-color-red">NEVER</span> be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01J18B809YSA4AQZRH0VQNM924">SFTP</h3>
<p>SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is the modern network protocol that transfers files between your computer and the web server. It provides the same functions as FTP while also encrypting your data during transfer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the data is encrypted, SFTP should <strong>always</strong> be used.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>FTP is an old term still commonly used to refer to transferring data to your server. For example, you may see this used in reference to an FTP client. However, modern apps only use the SFTP protocol since FTP is secure.</p>

<h2 id="h_01J18B809Y182YDAPC8GJHSV56">FTP and SFTP at DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>All website users at DreamHost are configured to use SFTP and port 22.</p>
<p>Whenever you use a program such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FileZilla</a> or <a href="https://cyberduck.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyberduck</a> to connect to your web server, always use port 22. This ensures you are using SFTP, so your data remains safe and protected.</p>
