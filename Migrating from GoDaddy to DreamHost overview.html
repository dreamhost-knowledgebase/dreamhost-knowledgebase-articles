<h2>Step 1 — Create a DreamHost account</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Sign up for any <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/">DreamHost plan</a>. View the following article for details:</li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">How to sign up for a DreamHost account </a></li>
</ul>
<li>During the signup process, select the <strong>I already have a domain</strong> option to add your current domain to your new account. <strong>This does NOT affect your current live website</strong>.</li>
<li>Complete the signup process.</li>
<li>Once your account is created, make sure that your domain is set up as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting" target="_self">Fully Hosted</a>. You may also need to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221691727-Creating-a-MySQL-database" target="_self">create a MySQL database</a> for your site if it depends on a database.</li>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>DreamHost sends you a 'request to transfer the registration' email after you complete the signup process, as well as information on how to access your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> account. You do <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;need to transfer your registration. It can remain at your current registrar for now. You can always transfer&nbsp;it at a later date.</p>

<h3>Migrating site databases</h3>
<h4>Exporting your site's database at GoDaddy</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://sso.godaddy.com/" target="_self">Log in</a> to your GoDaddy account.</li>
<li>Once logged in, select the link for the <a href="https://account.godaddy.com/products">My Products</a> page.</li>
<li>Under the <span class="text-section">Web Hosting</span> section, find your domain and click the&nbsp;<strong>Manage</strong>&nbsp;button next to it.</li>
<li>In GoDaddy’s panel, on the top menu bar, select <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong>.</li>

<li>Go to the top menu and click the <strong>Export</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Quick</strong> as your export method and <strong>SQL</strong> as your Format. Press the <strong>Go</strong> button, and the database will then download to your computer.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Uploading your database at DreamHost</h4>
<ol>
<li>Log into your DreamHost account and navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=advanced.mysql" target="_self">MySQL Databases</a> page.</li>
<li>Log into&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221610868-phpMyAdmin-Finding-your-login-credentials">phpMyAdmin</a>.</li>

<li>Click the <strong>Go</strong> button at the bottom to import the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>All tables will show when selecting the database in the left panel of phpMyAdmin.</p>
<p>Once the database is uploaded, you will likely need to update your site's config file to connect to the new database. Please review the following article for a list of popular software and their config files:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021570592-Error-establishing-a-database-connection">Incorrect database credentials in your config file</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="email">Email</span></h3>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You may be accustomed to seeing references to "secureserver" on GoDaddy, which reference your mail servers. If you are using DreamHost email services, your new email server information can be found <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038#Server_names">here</a>, and webmail login is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216540008#Accessing_webmail">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can import your email messages from your GoDaddy-hosted email addresses to your new DreamHost mail services. View the following article for instructions on this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215730827-Import-another-host-s-email-into-DreamHost">Import another host's email into DreamHost</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028389972-Google-Workspace-overview" target="_self" rel="undefined">Google Workspace addresses</a> don't need to be migrated between hosts. You should only need to update your DreamHost-provided MX records to ensure that your domain points to Google Workspace after the migration. View the following article for more details on this process.</p>

<div id="stepfour" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Step 4 — View your site at DreamHost before updating DNS</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/migrate-from-godaddy-03.svg" alt="Point the hosts file" width="639" height="213" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that your website has been migrated to DreamHost's servers, it's time to check the site to confirm it looks and functions as intended. View the following article for information on how to create a 'Mirror' domain. This allows you to see your site as it appears on DreamHost's servers before updating your DNS at your current host:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214695758-Previewing-your-site-with-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain-before-changing-DNS">Previewing your site with a dreamhosters.com subdomain before changing DNS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to create a 'Mirror' domain, you can also view your site using the <span class="text-object">hosts</span> file on your home computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006086308-View-your-DreamHost-site-using-a-hosts-file">View your DreamHost site using a hosts file</a></li>

<div class="steps-section--step"><img class="steps-number-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/number-5.svg" width="50px" />
<div id="stepfive" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Step 5 — Point your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/migrate-from-godaddy-04.svg" alt="Point DNS" width="639" height="213" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>At this point, your website and all its files are on DreamHost's servers, but your site is still 'hosted' at GoDaddy. You must now update your DNS to point to DreamHost. View the following article for instructions on how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DreamHost-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">What DreamHost DNS records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the DNS is resolving to DreamHost, visiting your site displays the site as it appears on your DreamHost server.</p>

<h2>Transfer your registration to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once the site's hosting and DNS have been moved over to DreamHost, you may want to move the domain's registration over as well. You can review the following article for instructions on how to transfer your domain registration to DreamHost:</p>
