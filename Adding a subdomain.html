<h2 id="h_01HAN4XFW5DPSBASHJ6VCMAGJS">Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A subdomain is a domain or DNS record that is added to a primary domain. For example, if your primary domain was <strong>example.com</strong>, you could add a subdomain to it named <strong>blog.example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>The 'blog' part in front of the primary domain is what makes it a subdomain. This is because domains are read from the right to left. In the example of <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, the three sections break down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>.com — This is the top-level domain (TLD)</li>
<li>example.&nbsp;— This is your unique domain name</li>
<li>blog.&nbsp;— This is the subdomain</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HAN4XFW5PDWNT1BBSKEPX711">Two ways to add a subdomain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two ways to add a subdomain at DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li>As its own Fully Hosted subdomain&nbsp;— This means it will be its own unique website.</li>
<li>As a Custom DNS record — This is only a DNS record that points away from DreamHost.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections explain both methods.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HAN4XFW53XEGMA5XRDVDQG6C">Option 1 — Adding a Fully Hosted subdomain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Adding a Fully Hosted subdomain is the same as adding a primary domain. View the following article for full instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting">Adding a website and hosting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the subdomain, it is automatically added to the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a>&nbsp;page&nbsp;under the primary domain. You can then host a new website on this subdomain.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you receive the following error message:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">You can't add that domain: you must add the parent domain example.com <br />to your account before adding a subdomain to it.</pre>
</div>
<p>It means that the primary domain is not yet in the system. A subdomain can only be created if its primary domain is created first (<strong>example.com</strong>). This is necessary even if you don't plan on hosting the second-level domain at DreamHost.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the subdomain is set as Fully Hosted, an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217294917-IP-Address">IP</a> address is assigned. If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are not hosted with DreamHost you must point your A records to this IP.</p>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS article</a> for instructions on how to view this new IP address.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HAN4XFW5R3J7V5P58EP5DPR7">Option 2&nbsp;— Adding a subdomain as a Custom DNS record</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are hosting the primary domain at DreamHost (<strong>example.com</strong>), but want to host the subdomain at another company (<strong>blog.example.com</strong>), you should create a 'Custom DNS' record instead. This allows you to set the IP address of the subdomain to point to another hosting provider.</p>
<p>View the following article that describes how to add an 'A Record' as a custom DNS record. This is the same method you'll use to create your subdomain.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HAN4XFW57AYA18C7VJP0W9DP">Propagation time</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After the domain is added, the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a>. This can take 4-6 hrs. You can use either of the following links to confirm that the DNS has updated in your location:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatsmydns.net</a> — A popular site that checks DNS records around the world.</li>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes.

<p>The above examples show how to create a subdomain that is Fully Hosted at DreamHost, or points to a different hosting company. There are also a few other ways you can use with a subdomain at DreamHost. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirect</li>
<li>Mirrored</li>
</ul>
