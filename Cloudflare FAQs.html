<h2><span id="What_files_are_distributed_on_Cloudflare.27s_CDN.3F">What files are distributed on Cloudflare's CDN?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Only static files that are accessible via <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> (or <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>) will be distributed on Cloudflare's CDN. This means that scripts or other files not accessible via <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> (for example, files in your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">user's home directory</a> outside of your web directory) are not shared with Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Cloudflare can only cache resources or data on your server or site directly. External resources (such as content linked from other sites) is not cached. Cloudflare caches based on file type and does not cache by MIME type. For a full list of cached static content by file extension, please see:</p>

<h2><span id="I_lost_the_password_for_my_cloudflare.com_account._How_can_I_retrieve_it.3F">I lost the password for my cloudflare.com account. How can I retrieve it?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Use the Cloudflare <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/forgot-password" target="_self" rel="undefined">forgot your password link</a> to reset your password. You will need to know one of the domains you have registered with the account in order to continue. If you have no domains attached to the account, you can leave the domain field blank. Remember, DreamHost has no access to your Cloudflare.com account and cannot help with this. It can only be done directly through Cloudflare.</p>

<h2><span id="Does_Cloudflare_have_access_to_my_MySQL_databases.3F">Does Cloudflare have access to my MySQL databases?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. Cloudflare only connects to your web server via <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> (or <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>) just like any normal visitor would access your site.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Do_you_share_any_of_my_personal_information_with_CloudFlare.3F">Do you share any of my personal information with Cloudflare?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. The only information DreamHost gives to Cloudflare is the necessary information they need to set up your account. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>email address you select for your Cloudflare account.</li>
<li>username (optional) that you choose when creating your Cloudflare account. NOTE: This is NOT your DreamHost username.</li>
<li>password you typed in when creating your Cloudflare account. NOTE: This does NOT need to be the same password as your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>domain(s) and subdomain(s) you wish to set up through Cloudflare.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your name or billing information is never shared with Cloudflare. Any paid Cloudflare subscription that you subscribe to through the DreamHost panel will be billed directly by DreamHost. If you want to subscribe to any paid services directly through Cloudflare, you must provide billing information directly with Cloudflare.</p>

<h2><span id="I.E2.80.99m_no_longer_able_to_connect_via_SSH_or_FTP_to_my_hostname._How_do_I_fix_this.3F">I’m no longer able to connect via SSH or FTP to my hostname. How do I fix this?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you enable Cloudflare for the domain, the domain’s www or subdomain DNS record is updated to point to Cloudflare’s servers. The domains nameservers do not change – only the A record is changed. This means if you used the www subdomain to connect via FTP or SSH, you’ll need to use the server name instead.
