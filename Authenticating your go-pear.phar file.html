<li><a href="http://pear.php.net/">http://pear.php.net/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
<p>If you downloaded the go-pear.phar file from php.net from July 2018 to Jan 2019, there's a possibility you downloaded an infected file. You should check to confirm the authenticity of this file.</p>
<h2>Why would I have downloaded this file?</h2>
<p>There are several PHP installations that require PEAR. For example:</p>

<h2>How do I check the go-pear.phar file's authenticity?</h2>
<p>The following steps walk you through how to check your current go-pear.phar file.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> to log into your site where you are currently using PEAR.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory you previously downloaded the go-pear.phar file to. This is most likely your user's home directory.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cd ~</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Check the md5sum value.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">md5sum go-pear.phar</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>When you run this command, a long string of numbers and letters is returned. The infected file has the following hash value.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">1e26d9dd3110af79a9595f1a77a82de7</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>If you see this value returned, you should proceed to disable the previous PEAR installation files and folders.
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv go-pear.phar go-pear.phar_COMPROMISED</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv .pearrc .pearrc_COMPROMISED</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">mv pear pear_COMPROMISED</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Next, download a fresh copy of the go-pear.phar file here:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">wget https://github.com/pear/pearweb_phars/blob/master/go-pear.phar</span></pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>You can then use the newly downloaded file to re-install PEAR using this article:
