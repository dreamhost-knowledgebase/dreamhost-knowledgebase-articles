<h2>Can DreamHost transfer a registration for me?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">

</ul>
</div><h2>Will the registration time period change?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Transferring your domain registration adds a one-year renewal to the current registration expiration date, so no registration time is lost. This renewal is active once the transfer-in completes.</p>
</div><h2>What TLDs can be transferred?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost only allows certain supported TLDs to be transferred in. The following TLDs are <strong>NOT</strong>Â supported for incoming transfers at DreamHost: .AM, .AT, .BZ, .FM, .JP, .org.NZ, .net.NZ, and .WS.</p>
