<h2>Will the registration time period change?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In most cases, transferring your domain registration adds a one-year renewal to the current registration expiration date, so no registration time is lost. This renewal is active once the transfer-in completes.</p>
<p>For more information about registration time periods for specific TLDs, see the following link:</p>
