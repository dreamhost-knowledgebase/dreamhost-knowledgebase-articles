<h2>Can DreamHost transfer my registration for me?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. All transfers must be done by the customer.</p>
</div>
<h2>Are DNS records copied to DreamHost when I transfer a domain?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. Transferring a domain only moves the registration. DNS records are controlled by your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview" target="_self">nameservers</a> and will need to be recreated if you point your DNS to DreamHost.</p>

<h2>Will the registration time period change?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In most cases, transferring your domain registration adds a one-year renewal to the current registration expiration date, so no registration time is lost. This renewal is active once the transfer-in completes.</p>
