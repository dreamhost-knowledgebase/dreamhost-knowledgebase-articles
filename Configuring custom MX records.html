<p>This article explains how to update your MX records to point to another email provider.&nbsp;This will redirect all new email to the new email hosting company.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<ul>
<li>Only enter custom records if your email service is hosted at a different company and you want your site's email delivered there. This means your email will no longer be delivered to DreamHost.</li>
<li>Custom MX records only apply to the domain or subdomain you add through the DreamHost panel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01HAPQ8NFF1B0X27JHTCR136JK">Adding custom MX records</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Obtain the MX records from your new email hosting provider.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom MX</a> page.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p><strong>Google Workspace users</strong></p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028389972-Google-Workspace-overview" target="_self" rel="undefined">enabled Google Workspace</a> on your domain in the DreamHost panel, you will see <strong>Google Workspace</strong>&nbsp;to the right of your domain. This means your MX records are already pointed to Google where it's currently hosted.</p>
<p>If you have already purchased Google Workspace directly through Google and not DreamHost, you'll need to add custom MX records that point to Google as shown below.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>To the right of your domain/subdomain, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <span class="text-section">Custom MX Records</span> section.

<h2 id="h_01HAPQ8NFF704YPX31J19CJSVM">FAQs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01HAPQ8NFFFQBBBDGDVVM9QVG5">Can I change the Time To Live (TTL) for my MX records?</h3>
<p>Yes, but you will need to contact support. View the following article for more information on DreamHost's TTL settings:</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HAPQ8NFFCNKNYWWFRKGCMRRZ">Do I need to enter the dot at the end of the record?</h3>
<p>No. The DreamHost system will add this automatically.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HAPQ8NFFWJCM0RPRHXJJ41KE">How do I locate my new provider's DNS records?</h3>
<p>Your new mail provider will give you the MX records you need to enter on this page. They may also give you Custom A or Custom CNAME records to add as well, but those must be added on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=domain.dashboard#!/list-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a> page as Custom DNS records. View the following article for instructions on how to add those (if necessary):</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HAPQ8NFF9BSNYJCQSZ0JSG36">Other considerations</h3>
<p>Any DreamHost-hosted mail accounts you currently use will remain active, but existing old emails may not be saved. You can download them in your panel by running a full account backup.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=mail.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Email</a> page will no longer display or let you configure the old addresses.</p>
<p>To use custom MX records with an external spam filtering service that sends all emails back to DreamHost for delivery to your mail accounts hosted here, see the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215832878-How-do-I-use-an-MSP-with-DreamHost-">Mail Service Provider instructions</a>.</p>
