<p>This article introduces you to DreamHost’s most important services that you need to set up your website. While this doesn't cover everything, it does cover the basics and it’s a good place to start after you purchase an account.</p>
<p>The standard hosting plans are '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared, VPS, and Dedicated</a>'. DreamHost also offers specialized plans called <a href="#DreamPress_Hosting">DreamPress</a> (WordPress hosting) and <a href="#Remixer_Hosting">Remixer</a> (simple website builder).</p>
<h2>Creating a DreamHost account</h2>
<p>If you wish to use any DreamHost services, you must create an account. View the following article for instructions on how to open an account.</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Logging_into_the_panel">Logging into the panel</span></h2>
<p>Once you finish the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">signup process</a>, you’ll receive a message to notify you that your account is set up. From there, you can log in to the panel at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/">https://panel.dreamhost.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To log in, use the credentials within the email that was sent to you.</p>
<h2><span id="Setting_up_your_domain">Setting up your domain</span></h2>
<p>Once you log in to your panel, there are a few things you must do to set up your website. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">Register a domain</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Add a hosting plan</a></li>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Registering_a_domain">Registering a domain</span></h2>
<p>To load any web page, the owner must first own the registration of the domain name. If you do not own the registration, you have no right to use the domain name.</p>
<p>To register a domain, go to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>On the Registrations page, you can register any domain you wish that is still available:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_reg_basics.fw.png" alt="01 reg basics.fw.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>DreamHost allows the registration of many different Top Level Domains (TLDs). You can view a full list of these on the Registrations page by clicking the ‘See all domain extensions and pricing’ link.</p>
<p>For further information, please review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">Domain Registration</a> article.</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_a_hosting_plan">Adding a hosting plan</span></h2>
<p>After you purchase a registration, you must then add the domain to your panel as FULLY HOSTED in order for it to resolve online.</p>
<p>To add a hosting plan to your account, go to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Billing &amp; Account’ &gt; ‘Manage Account’</a>) page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>On the Manage Account page, you’ll see a section titled ‘Service Plans’:</em></dd>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/02_Getting_Started.fw.png" alt="02 Getting Started.fw.png" width="841" height="143" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you already added a plan, you’ll see it listed here. In this example, a ‘Shared’ hosting plan has been added which is paid upfront at $119.40 for the entire year.</p>
<h2><span id="Adding_hosting_to_a_domain">Adding hosting to a domain</span></h2>
<p>After you add a hosting plan, you can now add hosting to your website.</p>
<p>To add hosting,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Hosting to a Domain / Sub-Domain</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>The ‘Manage Domains’ page opens and displays with the following options:</em></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Hosted</strong>: Configures the site to be hosted at DreamHost. Most often, this is the option you'll choose.</li>
<li><strong>Redirect</strong>: Forwards visitors to your site to another website.</li>
<li><strong>Mirrored</strong>: Allows your site to use the same files as another site as long as it is Fully Hosted and on the same DreamHost account.</li>
<li><strong>Parked</strong>: Displays a placeholder with a DreamHost “coming soon” message.</li>
<li><strong>Cloaked</strong>: Displays another site of your choice with a modified display URL and browser title.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Only</strong>: Creates custom DNS records that point your domain away from DreamHost. This is unavailable for subdomains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Even if you set a site to be FULLY HOSTED in your panel, that still does not mean it’s hosted at DreamHost. Your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> records must also point to your DreamHost server. The company that hosts your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a> controls your DNS. You can check where the nameservers are pointed by looking up your public WHOIS information here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/">http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the nameservers are set to DreamHost already, then all you need to do is set up hosting. View the following articles for further information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Adding Domains &amp; Subdomains</a></li>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Creating_an_email_address">Creating an email address</span></h2>
<p>Once you add hosting to a domain, you can then create an email address(es).</p>
<p>To create an email address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Manage Email’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the Create New Email Address button at the top.
<dl>
<dd><em>You’ll then be able to enter a new email and a password.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you save the changes, the necessary DNS records for mail are added to your site’s DNS.</p>
<p>More information can be found at <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215029918-How-do-I-add-an-email-address-">Email Setup</a> regarding the creation and configuration of email accounts with DreamHost.</p>
<p>It is also possible to host your email outside of DreamHost. To host elsewhere, you can configure custom MX records to point to your external mail host. Visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215032408-What-is-an-MX-record-">MX record</a> article for further instructions.</p>
