</div>
<h2 class="header-section">Add a hosting plan</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you purchase a registration, you must then add a hosting plan in order for it to resolve online. There are a few different hosting options you can use for your domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Fully hosted</a>&nbsp;— your site is hosted on a server and is visible online</li>

<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a>&nbsp;— your site is Fully Hosted and running WordPress, but it's hosted on the DreamPress plan</li>

<p>Even if you set a site to be FULLY HOSTED in your panel, that still does not mean it’s hosted at DreamHost. Your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> records must also point to your DreamHost server. The company that hosts your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a> controls your DNS. You can check where the nameservers are pointed by looking up your public WHOIS information here:</p>

</ul>

<p>If the nameservers are set to DreamHost already, then all you need to do is set up hosting. View the following articles for further information:</p>

<h2>Adding WordPress</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>WordPress is the world's most popular content management system (CMS), and DreamHost is one of the very few recommended providers by WordPress.org. If you're new to hosting a website, you'll want to check out WordPress to help you build your website. Within minutes, you can build a site that incorporates all of the modern features that websites now include, with a nearly limitless capacity to add new features as you need them.</p>

<h2>WordPress migration service options</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost can help you migrate your site, whether it's through the paid WordPress Migration Service or the complimentary DreamPress migration tool using the panel, which are both described below.</p>
<h3><span id="paid">Paid option to migrate your site</span></h3>
<p>If you are having trouble migrating your website from another host, or just don't have the time, DreamHost currently offers a service that takes care of that for you. You can find more information in the DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360027686731-Website-migration-services" target="_self">Website migration services</a> article.</p>
<h3>DreamPress option to migrate your site to a new domain</h3>
<p>You can also upgrade your new domain to DreamPress, which offers an Import option.</p>
<p>If your current WordPress site was installed and managed by DreamHost's One-Click Installer, you can set up DreamPress on the new domain name and import the content of the current WordPress site into the new DreamPress domain. You can add DreamPress on a new domain on your DreamHost panel at <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=wordpress.dreampress&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed WordPress</a>. Please see the following guide for how to import content in DreamPress:</p>

<h2 class="header-section">Add an SSL certificate</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Adding an SSL certificate to a domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you set up hosting for your domain, it's highly recommended that you also add an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">SSL certificate</a> to it (either a free '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216539548-Adding-a-free-Let-s-Encrypt-certificate">Let's Encrypt</a>' or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089748-How-do-I-purchase-a-professionally-signed-SSL-certificate-">professionally-signed</a> certificate). Adding a certificate is a simple process that not only secures your site for transactions and eCommerce, but also ensures that your site is rated as secure. In fact, Google will <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360003425491-Not-Secure-warning-in-Google-Chrome">more favorably rank it</a> since having a secure site is an important factor in search rankings.</p>
