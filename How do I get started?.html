<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">Register a domain</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Add a hosting plan</a></li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Registering_a_domain">Registering a domain</span></h2>
<p>To load any web page, the owner must first own the registration of the domain name. If you do not own the registration, you have no right to use the domain name.</p>
<p>To register a domain, go to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Registrations’</a>) page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>On the Registrations page, you can register any domain you wish that is still available:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 reg basics.fw.png" height="146" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_reg_basics.fw.png" width="755"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>DreamHost allows the registration of many different Top Level Domains (TLDs). You can view a full list of these on the Registrations page by clicking the ‘See all domain extensions and pricing’ link.</p>
<p>For further information, please review the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">Domain Registration</a> article.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_a_hosting_plan">Adding a hosting plan</span></h2>
<p>After you purchase a registration, you must then add the domain to your panel as FULLY HOSTED in order for it to resolve online.</p>
<p>To add a hosting plan to your account, go to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Billing &amp; Account’ &gt; ‘Manage Account’</a>) page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>On the Manage Account page, you’ll see a section titled ‘Service Plans’:</em></dd>
<dd><img alt="02 Getting Started.fw.png" height="143" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/02_Getting_Started.fw.png" width="841"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you already added a plan, you’ll see it listed here. In this example, a ‘Shared’ hosting plan has been added which is paid upfront at $119.40 for the entire year.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_hosting_to_a_domain">Adding hosting to a domain</span></h2>
<p>After you add a hosting plan, you can now add hosting to your website.</p>
<p>To add hosting,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Domains’ &gt; ‘Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Hosting to a Domain / Sub-Domain</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>The ‘Manage Domains’ page opens and displays with the following options:</em></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Hosted</strong>: Configures the site to be hosted at DreamHost. Most often, this is the option you'll choose.</li>
<li><strong>Redirect</strong>: Forwards visitors to your site to another website.</li>
<li><strong>Mirrored</strong>: Allows your site to use the same files as another site as long as it is Fully Hosted and on the same DreamHost account.</li>
<li><strong>Parked</strong>: Displays a placeholder with a DreamHost “coming soon” message.</li>
<li><strong>Cloaked</strong>: Displays another site of your choice with a modified display URL and browser title.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Only</strong>: Creates custom DNS records that point your domain away from DreamHost. This is unavailable for subdomains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Even if you set a site to be FULLY HOSTED in your panel, that still does not mean it’s hosted at DreamHost. Your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> records must also point to your DreamHost server. The company that hosts your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a> controls your DNS. You can check where the nameservers are pointed by looking up your public WHOIS information here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>If the nameservers are set to DreamHost already, then all you need to do is set up hosting. View the following articles for further information:</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="DreamPress_Hosting">DreamPress Hosting</span></h2>
<p>If you’re planning on hosting a WordPress site, DreamHost also offers DreamPress. DreamPress is a per-domain paid hosting service in which a user’s WordPress site is placed on two managed and scalable private servers with improved caching and memory.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creating_an_email_address">Creating an email address</span></h2>
<p>Once you add hosting to a domain, you can then create an email address(es).</p>
<p>To create an email address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the (<a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Manage Email’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the Create New Email Address button at the top.
<dl>
<dd><em>You’ll then be able to enter a new email and a password.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you save the changes, the necessary DNS records for mail are added to your site’s DNS.</p>
<p>More information can be found at <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215029918-How-do-I-add-an-email-address-">Email Setup</a> regarding the creation and configuration of email accounts with DreamHost.</p>
<p>It is also possible to host your email outside of DreamHost. To host elsewhere, you can configure custom MX records to point to your external mail host. Visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215032408-What-is-an-MX-record-">MX record</a> article for further instructions.</p>
