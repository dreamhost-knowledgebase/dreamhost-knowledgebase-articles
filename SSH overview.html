<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><strong>SSH</strong>, (or <strong>Secure Shell)</strong>, is a cryptographic network protocol used to secure network connections over an unsecured network. To use SSH, you must use an SSH client to connect to the server. Once connected, you can manually run commands within a terminal application.</p>
<p>All connections within your SSH client travel over a secured connection, rather than plain text. Because of this, the connection is encrypted and secure.</p>
<h3>SSH versions at DreamHost</h3>
<p>Servers running Ubuntu 18 (Bionic) run SSH version 7.6p1. Servers running Debian Stretch run version 7.4p1.</p>
</div>
<h2>Difference between SSH and FTP</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>FTP</h3>
<p>FTP uses an FTP client (such as Filezilla) to connect to the server. This client is a visual client in that you can see directories and files on your local computer and the server as icons. You can then click on these icons to interact as needed. For example:</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/misc-ssh-filezilla.png" width="600" height="447" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest drawbacks about FTP is that you cannot run specific commands to accomplish a specific task. With FTP, you can upload/download files and directories. You can rename them as well, but you cannot run a command that 'does' anything.</p>
<h3>SSH</h3>
<p>With SSH, you use a terminal (or Shell) client to connect to the server. There are no visual depictions of data within the Shell. Everything is command line text. For example, this command checks the nameservers for dreamhost.com:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">dig ns +short dreamhost.com</span>
ns1.dreamhost.com
ns2.dreamhost.com
ns3.dreamhost.com</pre>
</div>
<p>In this environment, you can type in commands to run specific tasks or tools, which is not possible with FTP.&nbsp;For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217213327-Wget">wget</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216688028-cURL-overview">curl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840708-Traceroute">traceroute</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216661778-Rsync">rsync</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000683852-Using-the-top-command-to-troubleshoot-your-website">top</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216560958-Website-tools#Command_line_tools">other tools</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These tools can make it much easier to troubleshoot and manage your website. However, SSH can be difficult to use for new users, so some knowledge of the UNIX Shell is highly recommended.</p>
</div>
<h2>Should I use SSH or FTP?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>SSH can do everything FTP can, however it's more difficult to use and isn't recommended for beginners. If you're making simple adjustments to your website such as uploading/download files, FTP is the easier choice.</p>
<p>If you need to run specific commands, SSH is needed.</p>

<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Step 1 — Enabling Shell access</h3>
<p>Before you are able to log into your server via SSH, you must change your website user to a SHELL user in the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/">panel</a>. This process is detailed in the following 'Enabling Shell Access' article:</p>

<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Step 2 — Opening up a terminal application</h3>
<p>A terminal is a program you use to type Shell commands.&nbsp;There are several terminal clients (applications)&nbsp;you can use on any operating system. View the following article for the easiest options for Windows, Mac, and Linux:</p>

<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Step 3 — Locating your hostname</h3>
<p>When you're ready to log into your server via SSH, you'll need to know your hostname. This can differ depending on which type of server your site is on. View the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials#Finding_your_FTP_server_hostname">Finding your server name</a>' article for details on how to obtain the correct name.</p>
<p>The table below can also be used to locate your hostname.</p>

<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Step 4 — Logging into your server</h3>
<p>To log in, type in 'ssh', followed by your Shell username, an @ sign, then your server name. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ssh <span class="code-highlight">username</span>@<span class="code-highlight">server.dreamhost.com</span></span></pre>

<p><em>-or-</em></p>

<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ssh <span class="code-highlight">username</span>@<span class="code-highlight">example.com</span></span></pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Be sure to change <strong>example.com</strong>&nbsp;to your actual domain, or <strong>server.dreamhost.com</strong> to the server you're connecting to.</p>
</div>
<p>You are then asked for your Shell user's password. Enter this and you'll be logged in.</p>

<h2>How to configure passwordless login</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once you set up a shell user, you must enter your password each time when logging into the server. If you’d like to avoid entering your password each time, you can set up Passwordless Login. This way, you'll be able to automatically log in each time without needing to enter your password.</p>
