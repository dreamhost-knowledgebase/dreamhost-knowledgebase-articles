<h2>DreamHost Google Workspace Eligibility</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In order to sign up for Google Workspace through your DreamHost account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your domain must be registered or hosted (either Fully Hosted, Parked, Redirect, or 'DNS Only') within your DreamHost account.</li>
<li>You must live in a supported country (see Google's supported country list <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2891389?hl=en" target="_self">here</a>).</li>
<li>The domain cannot be actively using Google Workspace (or its predecessor, Google Apps).</li>
<li>The domain cannot have been used with a Google Workspace trial within the last 90 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a domain does not appear in the dropdown menu, it is not eligible for Google Workspace. Typically, this occurs due to the domain already having an account at Google. This can happen when the account was signed up for Workspace directly with Google, or from another Google Partner. If you're not sure why your domain is ineligible, please refer to Google's support documentation for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jira.dreamhost.com/browse/WIKI-2153" target="_self">Can't sign up my domain for a Google service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Google's support can help you reactivate the existing account, or purge it from their system so that you can create a new Workspace account.</p>
