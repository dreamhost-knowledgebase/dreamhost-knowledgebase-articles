<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost provides a simple four-step process in the panel to entirely close/cancel an account when only a Shared Hosting plan is active. If your DreamHost account has VPS services and/or Dedicated services without a Shared Hosting plan, refer instead to the links in the <a class="reference internal" href="#see_also">See also</a> section&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>If needed, you can still retain the option to keep your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration(s)</a> accessible at DreamHost.</p>
</div>
<h2>Viewing your hosting plan type</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

For example, if you're on a Shared Starter plan, it displays here:</p>

<h2>What happens to my Domain Registration(s) when I close my account?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost will not delete your domain registrations when you close your account. Any domain registrations previously purchased continue to remain active for the rest of their registration periods.</p>
<p>You can continue to log into your panel and manage your domain registrations as you did before.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<ul>
<li>Any domain registration fees <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215206997#domreg_renewal_refunds" target="_self">cannot be refunded</a>.</li>
<li>If you used a free domain registration prior to ending your hosting plan, you are <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528#paying-for-registration-after-canceling" target="_self">now responsible for paying the domain registration fee</a>.</li>
