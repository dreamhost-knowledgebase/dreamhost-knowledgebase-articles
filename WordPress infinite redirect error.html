<p>A common error that happens to WordPress sites is the 'infinite redirect' error. This can appear differently depending on your browser. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong></p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-05_wordpress_infinite_redirect_01.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Chrome</strong></p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-05_wordpress_infinite_redirect_02.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
<h2>Cause of the error</h2>
<p>This error is usually caused because the HOME and SITE URL within WordPress is not configured correctly. For example, if your site is <strong>example.com</strong>, the Home and Site URL in your database should point to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<p>If the Home and Site URL add 'www' to the URL, it may appear like this in your database:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://www.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will cause your site to redirect in a loop.</p>
