<p>Be sure that the email addresses you want to receive mail at are properly set up and working before changing the MX records to direct mail to the new location. If you change the MX records before setting up those mail accounts, or make an error when changing the MX records, emails sent to you may bounce back to the sender or be lost.</p>

<p><strong>Google Workspace users</strong></p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028389972-Google-Workspace-overview" target="_self" rel="undefined">enabled Google Workspace</a> on your domain in the DreamHost panel, you will see <strong>Google Workspace </strong>to the right of your domain. This means your MX records are already pointed to Google where it's currently hosted.</p>
<p>If you have already purchased Google Workspace directly through Google and not DreamHost, you'll need to add custom MX records that point to Google as shown below.</p>

<p>Regular DreamHost email is set by default. This means all MX and other mail DNS records are automatically created to send your emails to DreamHost's servers.</p>
<p>You can use the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> page to configure your domain's email addresses, both fully-hosted and forward-only.</p>
<h3>If the panel is pointing your MX records away from DreamHost</h3>

<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_mx_change_records_02.png" alt="change mx record" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If youâ€™ve previously pointed your MX records away from DreamHost in the panel, you'll see a button titled&nbsp;<strong>Make me regular now!</strong>. Click this if you want the panel to remove your custom MX records and set them back to DreamHost.</p>
