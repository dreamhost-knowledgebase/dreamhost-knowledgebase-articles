<p>When you decompress your mail file using the article above, the decompressed files are put into a folder titled something like <span class="text-object">x21563833</span>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/misc_windows_extracted_email_user.png" width="208" height="402" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>This folder contains a <span class="text-object">Maildir</span> folder. Click into this folder.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/misc_windows_extracted_email_maildir.png" width="202" height="213" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Within that folder you'll find your email folders and messages. For your Inbox messages, click into the <span class="text-object">/cur</span> or <span class="text-object">/new</span> folders. For all other messages, click into their folder and view their <span class="text-object">/cur</span> or <span class="text-object">/new</span> directories.</p>
<p>Emails will&nbsp;appear in the following format:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">1435986g36.V34I895305bS934136.homiemail-master
</pre>
</div>
<p>If you drag and drop this file into your mail client, it will not work. You must rename the file first.</p>
<p>Add .eml to the end of any mail file. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">1435986g36.V34I895305bS934136.homiemail-master.eml
</pre>
</div>
<p>Only when they end in this format will your mail client recognize the file type. You can then drag and drop this file into your client.</p>
