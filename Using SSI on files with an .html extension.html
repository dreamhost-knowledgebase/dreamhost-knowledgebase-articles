<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHostâ€™s servers are configured by default to only parse files with an <span class="text-object">.shtml</span> extension with server-side includes. If you ensure your files that include other files (using SSI) are named <span class="text-object">something.shtml</span> you won't have to do anything to get them to work.</p>
<p>However, some customers have transferred a site from a different server configuration where any <span class="text-object">.html</span> file was parsed for SSI. It can be difficult to rename all the files in a website, as well as fix any links between them. Because of this, DreamHost allows users to turn on parsing of ANY sort of file they'd like.</p>
<p>To do this, simply create a plain text file named <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> in the directory in which you'd like all files with a different extension to be parsed for SSI. Inside the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file, add this one line:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">AddHandler server-parsed .html</pre>
</div>
<p>Now any file ending in <span class="text-object">.html</span> will have SSI run on it. DreamHost really does not recommend doing this, unless it is absolutely necessary. It adds some overhead to the web serving to parse in SSI as each and every request for an <span class="text-object">.html</span> file (even ones that don't have any SSI in them) is slightly slower when you turn on this option. It's much better to just name the appropriate files with the <span class="text-object">.shtml</span> extension.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Another way to accomplish this is to enable "XBitHack" via your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file by adding this line:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">XBitHack on</pre>
</div>
<p>Then, set the user execute bit on the <span class="text-object">.html</span> file using either of the following commands:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod u+x <span class="code-highlight">yourfile.html</span></span>
</pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em><strong>-or-</strong></em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod 744 <span class="code-highlight">yourfile.html</span></span>
