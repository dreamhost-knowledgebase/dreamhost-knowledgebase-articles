<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every installation of PHP comes with default settings which are usually fine for most websites. Occasionally, the needs of a website make it necessary to adjust these PHP settings. Creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini (phprc)</a> file is the solution to adjust the PHP settings for your website.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The standard term for a PHP configuration file is <span class="text-object">php.ini</span>. However, DreamHost uses the term <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file instead. This acts the same way – only the name is different. In this article, only the term phprc is used.</p>
</div>
<p>You can create a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file using an FTP client, or by logging into the server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200668-How-do-I-create-a-phprc-file-via-SSH-" target="_self">SSH</a>, however&nbsp;creating a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file is easier using an FTP client. This article uses Filezilla as the FTP client.</p>

<h2>Killing off running PHP processes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've saved your changes, you should kill off all running PHP processes. This ensures your new settings are updated. View the following article for instructions on how to do this in your panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748#Update_your_phprc_file_in_your_panel">How to update your phprc file in your panel</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Confirming your changes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, you should check to confirm the values have updated. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-Viewing-your-site-s-PHP-version-and-settings">phpinfo.php file</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">My phprc file isn't updating</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file you just created is used for any domains under this specific username that are also running the specific version of PHP you chose in step#6 when creating the directory.</p>
<p>For example, if the user has three domains where two are running PHP 7.3 and the third is running PHP 7.4, only the first two domains running 7.3 would be affected by the <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file. You would need to create a separate <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file for the PHP 7.4 site.</p>
