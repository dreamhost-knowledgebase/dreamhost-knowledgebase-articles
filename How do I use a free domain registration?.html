<h2>What is the free registration program?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you sign up for an annual <strong>Shared</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Starter </strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Shared </strong><strong>Unlimited</strong>,&nbsp;hosting plan or any annual&nbsp;<strong>DreamPress</strong> plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>You receive one (1) registration credit for free per DreamHost account.</li>
<li>You can use this registration credit to register a new domain name (<strong>.art</strong>, <strong>.biz</strong>, <strong>.blog</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.club</strong>, <strong>.co</strong>, <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.design</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.info</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.me</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.net</strong>, <strong>.online</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.org</strong>, <strong>.shop</strong>, <strong>.site</strong>, .<strong>store</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.tech</strong>, <strong>.us</strong>, <strong>.work</strong>, or <strong>.xyz</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use (or transfer) the free domain registration and then close your 'Shared Starter'/'Shared Unlimited' hosting or DreamPress plan before your annual period has completed, you are responsible for the cost of the registration for which the credit was used. Usually this amount is deducted from your refund, unless there is a balance due on the account before you cancel. You also continue to own the domain name until it expires.</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>How can I check if I have a free credit on my account?</h3>
<h4><strong>If you have a registration in your account</strong></h4>
<p>You can check this in your panel, on the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registrations</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>If you have a free credit available, the price for the renewal of the selected domains mentioned above is listed as “$0.00”.</p>
<p>For an example, please refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Dom_reg2.fw.png" alt="Dom_reg2.fw.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If this page shows a fee listed for your <strong>.art</strong>, <strong>.biz</strong>, <strong>.blog</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.club</strong>, <strong>.co</strong>, <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.design</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.info</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.me</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.net</strong>, <strong>.online</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.org</strong>, <strong>.shop</strong>, <strong>.site</strong>, .<strong>store</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.tech</strong>, <strong>.us</strong>, <strong>.work</strong>, or <strong>.xyz</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>domain renewal, this means that your free credit has already been used for the year.</p>
<h4><strong>If you DO NOT have a registration in your account</strong></h4>
<p>If no registrations are listed on this page, you can register a new domain using the <span class="text-object">Search Domain Names</span>&nbsp;box toward the top of the page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/free-reg-available.png" alt="free registration available" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>To the right, you will see a message confirming a free credit is available.</p>
<h3>I have DreamPress and Shared Unlimited — how many free domain registrations am I eligible for?</h3>
<p>One. If you have already received a free domain registration with an eligible hosting service, adding additional hosting services will not provide extra domain registrations.</p>
<h3>Who owns the free registration? DreamHost or me?</h3>
<p>You are the full owner of the domain registration that you use the credit towards.</p>
<h3>Can I use the credit for other services?</h3>
<p>No. This credit cannot be used toward any other services or items.</p>
<h3>If the registration is transferred away to another company, can I renew it at that other company for free?</h3>
<p>No. The free domain credit only applies to domains that are managed through your DreamHost panel.</p>
<h3>On what type of registrations can I use the free registration credit?</h3>
<p>While DreamHost does offer many different domain extensions, the free credit is only available for use on the following standard domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>.art</li>
<li>.biz</li>
<li>.blog</li>
<li>.club</li>
<li>.co</li>
<li>.com</li>
<li>.design</li>
<li>.info</li>
<li>.me</li>
<li>.net</li>
<li>.online</li>
<li>.org</li>
<li>.shop</li>
<li>.site</li>
<li>.store</li>
<li>.tech</li>
<li>.us</li>
<li>.work</li>
<li>.xyz</li>
</ul>
<p>The credit cannot be used for specialty domains or international country-specific domains.</p>
<h3>I used my free credit toward one registration, but intended to use it for another registration. Can this be changed?</h3>
<p>Yes. DreamHost support can assist you with applying the free credit toward a different domain, if requested. An example would be if you renewed two domains at the same time, but wanted the credit to be used on one domain instead of the other. Please note that the free credit change would not involve a change to your payment amount. If the free credit change results in a positive balance on your account, the balance would be applied to future charges as they arise.</p>
<p>DreamHost understands that some customers are resellers and have a reason to use the credit for a specific domain listed on their invoices. Please feel free to contact support on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Support</a> page if you need assistance with this.</p>
