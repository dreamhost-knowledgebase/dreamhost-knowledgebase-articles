<h2 id="h_01HHFFKZ924KKHV72JX51AGM8Y">What is the free registration program?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you sign up for a new account with an annual <strong>Shared</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Starter</strong>, <strong>Shared </strong><strong>Unlimited</strong>, or <strong>VPS</strong>&nbsp;hosting plan or any annual&nbsp;<strong>DreamPress</strong> plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>You receive one (1) registration credit for free per DreamHost account.</li>
<li>You can use this registration credit to register a new domain name (<strong>.blog</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.club</strong>, <strong>.co</strong>, <strong>.com</strong>, <strong>.design</strong>, <strong>.gay</strong>, <strong>.info</strong>, <strong>.ink</strong>, <strong>.io</strong>, <strong>.me</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.net</strong>, <strong>.online</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>.org</strong>, <strong>.shop</strong>, <strong>.site</strong>, .<strong>store</strong>, <strong>.tattoo</strong>, <strong>.tech</strong>, <strong>.tv</strong>, <strong>.us</strong>, <strong>.wiki</strong>, or <strong>.xyz</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use (or transfer) the free domain registration and then close your 'Shared Starter'/'Shared Unlimited' hosting or DreamPress plan before your annual period has completed, you are responsible for the registration cost for which the credit was used. Usually, this amount is deducted from your refund unless a balance is due on the account before you cancel. You also continue to own the domain name until it expires.</p>

<h4 id="h_01HHFFKZ93RX00G96WN8XKHS6Z"><strong>If you have a registration in your account</strong></h4>
<p>You can check this in your panel on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Registrations</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<ul>

<ul>

<li>To the right, you will see a message confirming a free credit is available.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HHFFKZ933B5JA9QZQBA9RQQH">I have DreamPress and Shared Unlimited — how many free domain registrations am I eligible for?</h3>
<p>One. Adding additional hosting services will not provide extra domain registrations if you have already received a free domain registration with an eligible hosting service.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HHFFKZ93R4QT3EHZ1P222DG1">Who owns the free registration? DreamHost or me?</h3>
<p>You are the full owner of the domain registration that you use the credit towards.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HHFFKZ938EYXTYP4HD02AHCH">Can I use the credit for other services?</h3>
<p>No. This credit cannot be used toward any other services or items.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HHFFKZ93Z4KCE7BKGJK49C6Y">If the registration is transferred away to another company, can I renew it at that other company for free?</h3>
<p>No. The free domain credit only applies to domains managed through your DreamHost panel.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HHFFKZ934KQ3EWMV7DEWWBHP">On what type of registrations can I use the free registration credit?</h3>
<p>While DreamHost does offer many different domain extensions, the free credit is only available for use on the following standard domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>.blog</li>
<li>.club</li>
<li>.co</li>
<li>.com</li>
<li>.design</li>
<li>.gay</li>
<li>.info</li>
<li>.ink</li>
<li>.io</li>
<li>.me</li>
<li>.net</li>

<li>.tattoo</li>
<li>.tech</li>
<li>.tv</li>
<li>.us</li>
<li>.wiki</li>
<li>.xyz</li>
</ul>
<p>The credit cannot be used for specialty domains or international country-specific domains.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HHFFKZ9393PE37WN1C4X7MQ4">I used my free credit for one registration but intended to use it for another. Can this be changed?</h3>
<p>Yes. DreamHost support can assist you with applying the free credit toward a different domain if requested. An example would be if you renewed two domains simultaneously but wanted the credit used on one domain instead of the other. Please note that the free credit change would not involve changing your payment amount. If the free credit change results in a positive balance on your account, the balance would be applied to future charges as they arise.</p>
<p>DreamHost understands that some customers are resellers and have a reason to use the credit for a specific domain listed on their invoices. Please contact support on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Support</a> page if you need assistance.</p>
