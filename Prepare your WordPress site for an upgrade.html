<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article describes how to prepare your WordPress website for an upcoming version release.</p>
<h3>Updating the PHP version of your site</h3>
<p>It's highly recommended that you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001331703-Upgrading-your-WordPress-site-to-the-latest-PHP-version">upgrade to the latest version of PHP</a> as it provides better performance and compatibility with the latest versions of WordPress.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Not all third-party themes and plugins have been updated to be compatible with PHP 8. If your site relies on a specific plugin or theme, make sure you verify that it is PHP 8 compatible before upgrading.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Back up your site and database</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before you make any updates to your WordPress site, DreamHost recommends backing up your WordPress installation. The steps are different depending on if your site was installed using the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-Install-WordPress-using-the-DreamHost-WordPress-installer" target="_self">DreamHost WordPress installer</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview" target="_self">DreamPress</a>.</p>
<h3 class="subtoc-heading">DreamHost WordPress install</h3>
<p>There are two options to back up a WordPress site created by the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-Install-WordPress-using-the-DreamHost-WordPress-installer" target="_self">DreamHost WordPress installer</a> in your panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089888-WordPress-backup-tools">Install a WordPress backup plugin</a> <em>(easiest)</em></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215768237-Manually-backing-up-website-data">Run a manual backup</a> <em>(advanced â€” requires using the command line and logging into your site via SSH)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Either option provides you with an off-site backup that allows you to quickly restore your site from in case an error occurs during the upgrade process.</p>
<h3 class="subtoc-heading">DreamPress</h3>
<p>DreamPress websites have the ability to create an on-demand backup in the DreamHost panel. View the following article for instructions on how back up your DreamPress website:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Update your plugins</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure plugins are updated before the new WordPress version is released.&nbsp;You may notice a week or two before a new release that a number of your site's plugins and themes have updates available. This is generally because the developers are preparing their plugins for a new release.</p>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to update your plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300817-Managing-WordPress-plugins">Managing WordPress plugins</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Manual or automatic plugin updates</h3>
<p>If the plugin is part of the core functionality of your site (e.g., WooCommerce) DreamHost suggests that you create a backup before updating (see above).</p>
<p>However, if the plugin is a more basic (e.g., Akismet) you may consider <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#enable-automatic-plugin-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabling automatic plugin updates</a> to ensure they are always at their latest version.</p>
</div>
<h2>Use a staging site to test the new version</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your site depends on essential functionality, such as eCommerce or memberships, it's best to create a staging site to test the new WordPress version before upgrading your live site.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Testing using staging site is not required, but it's a safe way to ensure your site will continue to function properly before upgrading.</span></p>
<h3 class="subtoc-heading">Setting up a staging site</h3>

</ul>
<p><strong>Plugin option</strong></p>
<p>Another option is to use a plugin such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/migrate-guru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Migrate Guru</a> to migrate your site files and database to a secondary install.</p>
</div>
<h2>Use the WordPress Beta Tester plugin to test the new version</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>The following steps are only necessary if there is an upcoming WordPress version available that is not yet officially released that you would like to test.</p>
</div>
<p>After you create a staging site (as mentioned above), use the following instructions to test a pre-release version of WordPress.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your staging site.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="text-section">Tools &gt; Beta Testing</span> and select the <span class="text-object">Bleeding Edge</span> option.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
<li>When the page reloads, select the <span class="text-object">Release Candidates Only</span> option.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong> again.</li>
<li>Navigate to <span class="text-section">Dashboard &gt; Updates</span>.
<dl>
<dd><em>When a Release Candidate (RC) of the next version of WordPress is available, you'll have the ability to update your staging site to it on this page:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Release Candidates are effectively "preview" copies of WordPress that are ready to release so long as there are no major or site-breaking bugs.</p>
</div>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Once your staging site is on the most recent Release Candidate, ensure that everything is fully functional. Here are a few things to check:
<ul>
<li>Do all pages display as they should?</li>
<li>Does anything unexpected happen when you browse or try to create new content?</li>
<li>If you run an eCommerce site, are you still able to add products to the cart and check out?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If something isn't functioning as expected, note what's breaking and reach out to the developer of the specific plugin or theme as they may already have a pending update that fixes your issue.</p>
</div>
