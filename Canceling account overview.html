<li>Refunds within the 97-Day Money-Back Guarantee can only be processed for shared hosting, per the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
<li>Domain registration fees are not refundable. If your domain registration was <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-">free</a> with your shared hosting plan, you will be required to pay for it when canceling the hosting plan.</li>

If, in the future, you would like to have your domain point to a different web host, you will be able to log in to the <a href="http://panel.dreamhost.com">DreamHost panel</a>, and make your changes to your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS settings</a> to point to the new host.</p>
<h2>Do I get my money back If DreamHost cancels my account?</h2>
