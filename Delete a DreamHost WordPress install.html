<p>This article explains how to delete WordPress installed via the DreamHost WordPress installer in the panel.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is deleted from the server?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you delete a DreamHost WordPress install, several files could be deleted depending on where the install is located. Make sure to read through the examples below before removing your DreamHost WordPress install.</p>
<h3>If your install is in the primary web directory</h3>
<p>The primary web directory of your site is the directory the server looks for to serve files. View the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">How to add a domain</a>' article. Step #4 shows where the web directory is located. You can also visit the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.installer&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install WordPress</a> page.</p>
<p>Click <strong>Manage my Apps</strong>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel_oneclicks_manage_apps_button.png" alt="Manage my apps button" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Next, click your website name. It will show a forward slash next to the DreamHost WordPress install icon.</p>
<dl>

</dl>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>When clicked, the <span class="text-object">Remove from List</span> button deactivates a DreamHost WordPress install and removes it from the list. It does NOT delete any files.</p>
</div>
<p>In general, this directory is the name of your website. For example, if your site is named <strong>example.com</strong>, your web directory would be <span class="text-object">/home/username/example.com</span> also. This means that when you visit your site at <strong>example.com</strong>, you're seeing the DreamHost WordPress install.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If this is where you've installed your DreamHost WordPress install, <strong>be very careful</strong> when deleting it in the panel. If you delete the DreamHost WordPress install stored in your primary web directory, <strong>ALL FILES</strong> in the web directory and all sub-directories are deleted. This means that if you have any subdirectories like <span class="text-object">example.com<strong>/images</strong></span> or <span class="text-object">example.com<strong>/blog</strong></span>, those are also deleted.</p>
<p>Make sure to only use this option if you want <strong>everything</strong> deleted from your website and server including all other files under this web directory. If you need any of those files or sub-directories, make sure to back them up before removing the DreamHost WordPress install.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3>If your install is in a sub-directory</h3>
<p>If your install is in a sub-directory such as <strong>example.com/blog</strong>, only the files within that sub-directory are deleted.</p>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>When clicked, the <span class="text-object">Remove from List</span> button deactivates a WordPress DreamHost WordPress install and removes it from the list. It does NOT delete any files.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, if your site was <strong>example.com/blog</strong>, only files within that <span class="text-object">/blog</span> sub-directory are deleted. However, the empty <span class="text-object">/blog</span> directory will remain. No files are touched above this directory, so anything within the <span class="text-object">/example.com</span> directory remains.</p>
