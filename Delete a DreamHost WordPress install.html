<h2 id="h_01HM5DZ2TSXPK7K302X92R393C">What is deleted from the server?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Several files may be deleted depending on where WordPress is installed within your website. For example, it could be installed in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Primary web directory (<strong>example.com</strong>)</li>
<li>In a Subdirectory (<span class="text-object">example.com</span><strong>/blog</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to read through the following sections before deleting your WordPress installation.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HM5DZ2TSHGT3KDXWB89VYR1P">Confirm where WordPress is installed</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To confirm where WordPress is installed on your website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=wordpress.installer#">Install WordPress</a> page.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage my Apps</strong>.</li>
<li>Click your website name.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h_01HM5DZ2TS380GJ2RMGZ49Z5J7" class="subtoc-heading">The primary web directory</h3>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-wordpress-delete-install.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If it's located in the primary web directory, you will see a forward slash next to the WordPress icon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-website-directory" target="_self">primary web directory</a> is the directory your website loads files from first. In general, this directory is the name of your website. For example, if your site is named <strong>example.com</strong>, your web directory would be <span class="text-object">/home/username/example.com</span> also.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>If this is where you've installed your DreamHost WordPress install, <strong>be very careful</strong> when deleting it in the panel. If you delete the DreamHost WordPress install stored in your primary web directory, <strong>ALL FILES</strong> in the web directory and all subdirectories are deleted. This means that if you have any subdirectories like <span class="text-object">example.com<strong>/images</strong></span> or <span class="text-object">example.com<strong>/blog</strong></span>, those are also deleted.</p>
<p>Make sure to only use this option if you want <strong>everything</strong> deleted from your website including all other files under this web directory. If you need any of those files or subdirectories, make sure to back them up before removing the DreamHost WordPress install.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HM5DZ2TSK40CBR6JRKZMP1VS" class="subtoc-heading">A subdirectory</h3>
<p>If WordPress is located in a subdirectory, it will show a forward slash followed by the subdirectory name.&nbsp;</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-wordpress-delete-install-subdirectory.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Deleting a subdirectory install will only delete the files within that specific subdirectory.&nbsp;For example, if your site was <strong>example.com/blog</strong>, only files within that <span class="text-object">/blog</span> subdirectory are deleted, however, the empty <span class="text-object">/blog</span> subdirectory will remain. No files are deleted above this directory, so anything within the <span class="text-object">/example.com</span> directory remains untouched.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01HM5DZ2TS7CZ1J6XZ13Q8XEQZ" class="subtoc-heading">Remove from List</h3>
<p>Clicking the <strong><span class="text-object">Remove from List</span></strong> button deactivates a DreamHost WordPress install so it is no longer managed by DreamHost. If you wish to continue using this WordPress install, you will then be responsible for keeping it updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This option removes it from the list, but it does NOT delete any files.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HM5DZ2TSKKQ544JMV95031WA" class="subtoc-heading">Delete all files</h3>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Delete all Files</strong> button deletes everything in the WordPress installation directory and removes it from the panel. Only use this option if you want <strong>ALL</strong> content under your WordPress installation deleted as noted above.</p>
<p>Make sure to back up any data you do not want to be deleted before clicking this button.</p>
