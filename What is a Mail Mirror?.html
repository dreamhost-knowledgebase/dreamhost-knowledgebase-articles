<p>Mail Mirroring is a quick way to create forwards for an entire domain.</p>
<p>For example, if you have 10 email addresses set up at <strong>example.com</strong>, you could create a mail mirror at <strong>blog.example.com</strong>. If you then send an email to any of those 10 addresses at <strong>blog.example.com </strong>(such as user@blog.example.com), they are automatically forwarded to the corresponding email at <strong>example.com</strong> (user@example.com).</p>
<p>Please note that you cannot log into any address at <strong>blog.example.com</strong> since it doesn't exist. The mirror just forwards to the real email address.</p>
<h2>A note about DNS</h2>
<p>This feature can only be used if example.com is using DreamHost to host its mail. If example.com is using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214984738-Anti-spam-overview">Anti-spam</a> filtering at DreamHost, you must also enable it for blog.example.com as well.</p>
<h2>Creating a Mail Mirror</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Custom MX’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the Edit button to the right of the domain you want to create a mirror for. This domain will probably not have any email addresses created. You're going to use this domain to Mirror the domain that already has email set up.</li>
<li>On the next page, scroll down to the 'Mail Mirror' section.

</li>
<li>From the dropdown, select the domain you want to Mirror mail for.</li>
<li>Click the button 'Mirror this domain's email addresses now!'. A success message displays notifying you that it will take a few hours for the DNS records to update online.</li>

<h2>How it functions</h2>
<p>If you've set up a Mail Mirror for blog.example.com that mirrors example.com, the mirror will work in the following way:
<ul>
<li>Mail sent to a blog.example.com (mirrored) address will be forwarded to the (real)  example.com address. For example, an email to user@blog.example.com will be viewable at user@example.com.</li>
</ul>
