<p>DreamHost provides an option to entirely close an account, although this option is only available while a shared hosting plan is active. If a DreamHost account has VPS services and/or Dedicated services without a Shared hosting plan, refer instead to the 'See also' links below.</p>
<h2>Viewing your hosting plan type</h2>
<p>You can view all services billed to your account on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Billing &amp; Account' &gt; 'Manage Account')</a> page. Here you'll see a list of all services you currently use.</p>
<h2>Closing your Shared hosting account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=billing.accounts">Panel &gt; ‘Billing &amp; Account’ &gt; ‘Manage Account’</a>) page.

</dl>
</li>
<li>At the top of the page (under your account number and name), click the ‘close account/end all hosting" link. You'll need your panel password to proceed. If you do not know it, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216479217-Change-password-Panel-users-">you can reset it</a>.
