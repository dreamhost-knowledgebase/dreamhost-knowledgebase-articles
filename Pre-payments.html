<h2 id="h_01HPQJCPCGJQEAR5QQHTT9EJ72">Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost panel allows you to make pre-payments on your account, however, the pre-payment does not apply to the charge or service(s) until it’s ready to renew. This means the pre-payment you submit will stay on your account as a positive credit balance until a charge/service becomes due.</p>
<p>You also aren't able to define to which charge or service the pre-payment will be applied to; the next charge on your account automatically withdraws from the existing credit balance.</p>
