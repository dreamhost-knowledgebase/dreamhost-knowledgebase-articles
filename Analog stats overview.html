<p>Analog is an open-source website statistics analysis program and is installed on all DreamHost servers by default, however you must manually enable it in your panel in order to use it.</p>
<p>You can enable stats on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.stats&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Advanced' &gt; 'Site Statistics'</a>) page by creating a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216510258">stats user</a>.</p>
<h2><strong><span id="Enabling_stats">Enabling stats</span></strong></h2>
<p>Visit the following article for full details on how to enable and view stats:</p>

<p>Some web applications (content management systems, blog software, and so on) may implement Apache url rewrite rules that can prevent you from reaching this page unless you modify those rules. General instructions for making such modifications (and specific instructions for certain commonly encountered web applications such as WordPress), can be found in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217068087">making stats accessible with htaccess</a> article.</p>

<h2><strong><span id="Summary_of_statistics_functions">Summary of statistics functions</span></strong></h2>
<p>The following is the first section to appear when a user logs into their site stats:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="01 Analog.fw.png" height="531" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Analog.fw.png" width="922"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>From the ‘Go To’ section at the top of the page, users are able to navigate to separate sections and summaries. The remaining area of ‘General Summary’ section is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Successful requests</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of times someone succeeded in accessing any file at your site.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Average successful requests per day</strong></dt>
<dd>The average number of requests if traffic remained consistent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Successful requests for pages</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of times someone succeeded in accessing a "page" file at your site (files ending in .html, .htm, .php, .cgi, and so on).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Average successful requests for pages per day</strong></dt>
<dd>The average number if site visits were consistent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Failed requests</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of times someone attempted to access a file from your site, but for whatever reason was unsuccessful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Redirected requests</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of times a visitor attempted to access a particular file, but was redirected to a different one by the server. There are two main reasons why this happens:
<ul>
<li>The visitor has incorrectly requested a directory name without the following slash. For example, a request for www.example.com/yourdirectory (the incorrect name) returns www.example.com/yourdirectory/ (the correct name).</li>
<li>"Click-thru" banner ads can also cause a request to be redirected.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Distinct files requested</strong></dt>
<dd>How many files (pages, pictures, programs, and so on) were requested from your site.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Distinct hosts served</strong></dt>
<dd>Basically, how many different people visited your site. The number can be slightly deceiving though, as customers of some large ISPs (e.g., AOL) go through a proxy server. As a result, a large number of visitors may be represented as a small number of distinct hosts.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Data transferred</strong></dt>
<dd>The total amount of data transferred.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Average data transferred per day</strong></dt>
<dd>What the average amount of data transferred would be with consistent traffic.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><strong><span id="Time-based_reports">Time-based reports</span></strong></h2>
<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, the report types can be split up by weekly, daily, and hourly summaries:</p>
<dl>

<dd>Breaks down requests and pages by the hour for the past day.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><strong><span id="Visitor-based_reports">Visitor-based reports</span></strong></h2>
