<p>DreamHost also recommends that you set up Secure Hosting which is consistent with your main domain's hostname, so that the URL either forces the www subdomain or removes it. You can choose to force or remove it on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains')</a> page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> link under the 'Web Hosting' column to the right of your domain.
<dl>
<dd><em>The 'Manage Domains' page appears for your domain:</em></dd>
<dd><img alt="01 Add a domain.png" height="265" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/01_Add_a_domain.png" width="1279"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Select which one of the three options you would like to use.
<dl>
<dd>If your domain is configured to be Fully Hosted, you'll see the following options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Leave it alone: Both</strong></li>
<li><strong>Add WWW</strong></li>
<li><strong>Remove WWW</strong></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
If you choose to add or remove WWW, requests actually work both ways but are rewritten internally by the Apache web server configuration. Either is perfectly safe to use unless you have installed software on the domain which is configured internally to rewrite its URL to use the opposite of what you've selected in your panel. If that's the case, you must reconfigure your installed software (i.e., WordPress, Joomla, ZenCart, and so on) to use the URL you have chosen in the panel.</li>

<p>When you purchase an SSL certificate, you are given the option to specify your URL, in that you can choose to add the www subdomain or remove it. DreamHost SSL certificates provide an extra feature that allows them to work with both. However, it's recommended that you still set up your Secure Hosting for the correct domain/subdomain and not rely on this feature to catch any mistakes.</p>
