<li>Depending on how much data is moved, It can take several hours to complete the migration to the new user.</li>
<li>To check the status of a single domain migration, check the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> page.

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There is no downtime during the move as the data is copied while the former server continues to serve the website. However, you should not work on your site during this 4-6 hrs time period. This is because it's possible your changes will be made to the old site, not the new. You should wait until the DNS has fully updated being continuing to work on your website.</p>
<p>When you migrate your domain to a different server, the IP of your site changes. If your domain is using DreamHost’s nameservers, then the domain’s IP is updated automatically.</p>
<p>If your domain is not using DreamHost’s <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a>, you’ll need to update your DNS records manually at the company where your nameservers are hosted.</p>
<p>You can see all of the DNS records that are set up for any site you host at DreamHost in your panel. Please note that after any DNS change, the records must propagate online.</p>
