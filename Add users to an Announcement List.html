<h2 id="h_01HQR51G88900HD54H87E0E220">Adding users</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.list&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announcement Lists</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the far right of your list.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <span class="text-section">Edit Subscriber List</span> section.</li>
<li>Make your edits to the list. The fields available to edit are:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li><strong>Current Subscriber List ():</strong> Shows the email addresses of those who are already subscribed to the list. The empty parenthesis is populated by the number of users on this list. This example shows no users added to the list.</li>
<li><strong>Emails To Add:</strong> To add an email address, enter the full email address in the provided field. Make sure to add only one email address per line.</li>
<li><strong>Email to Remove:</strong> Enter the email address you wish to permanently remove from your list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Modify Subscribers...</strong> button when finished editing to save.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Send Confirmation Now!</strong> to send the request.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Subscription confirmation emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>must be replied to in order to verify a subscription.</li>
<li>are sent by default from donotreply@dreamhost.com, which cannot be modified. Only announcements sent to current subscribers will be sent from the list's address, not the initial confirmation email.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The user then receives an email with a link to join the list.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If a user has already been sent a confirmation message for the list within the last 48 hours, they cannot be re-added to the list until that 48-hour window has expired. This is is to prevent the system from spamming users with potentially unwanted subscription notices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQR51G8895A99REXQRX8BK93">Viewing/editing user details</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once a user accepts to become added to the list, you'll see them listed in the <span class="text-section">Edit Subscriber List</span> section next to the words 'Current Subscriber List':</p>
<p>Three options appear on the left:</p>
<ul>
<li>show dates</li>
<li>shows names</li>
<li>show bounces</li>
</ul>
<p>In the screenshot above, all three are already selected, which displays the user information to the right of their email address.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>As you can see in the above screenshot, the name does not appear. Unfortunately, there is no way to edit an existing user to change the name. If you require a different name, you must remove the user, and then add again as shown in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQR51G897SEJ62T906DYE6AV">How can I assign a name to a user?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When adding the user to the 'Emails to Add' field for the first time, you can specify their name in this format:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">email@example.com John Doe</pre>
</div>
<p>You can only change the name when it's originally added. If you want to change it later, delete the address and add it again with a new name.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQR51G89M4TT66MDKDCGR9J7">How many emails can be added to the list?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There is no limit to the number of people you can add to a list. That is the reason why the list service should be used instead of sending a blast email to multiple contacts through your standard email address which has quota limits. SMTP limitations prevent this with your regular email address and other mail providers may have outgoing mail restrictions as well. So, the list service is ideal for sending a single email to a large amount of subscribers.</p>
<p>However, please note that it may take a while for all of the messages to go out if you have a very large list.</p>
<p>If a message sent for the list hasn’t been delivered and it’s been over a few hours, do <strong>not</strong> resend the message. <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">Contact support</a> so the mail logs can be checked.</p>
