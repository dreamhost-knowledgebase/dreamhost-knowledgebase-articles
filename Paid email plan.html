    If you no longer have a need for a website, you are able to downgrade to
    a registration-only account with a Paid Email plan. This allows you to continue
    to use email from your domain without hosting a website online.

    To proceed,
    <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Support</a>
    to request your current hosting plan be closed and a Paid Email plan added
    to it.

    <p>
      DreamHost will not delete your domain registrations when the hosting
      plan is closed. Any domain registrations previously purchased continue
      to remain active for the rest of their registration periods. You can
      continue to log into your panel and manage your domain registrations
      as you did before.
