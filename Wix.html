<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To point your domain from DreamHost to Wix, you must first <a href="https://www.wix.com/upgrade/website" rel="nofollow">upgrade your account at Wix to a premium plan</a>, then change your DNS settings.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>There are two options to point your DNS to Wix:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/connecting-a-domain-to-the-wix-name-servers" target="_self" rel="undefined">Pointing your nameservers</a> (Recommended)</li>
<li><a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-or-updating-a-records-in-your-wix-account" target="_self" rel="undefined">Pointing A records</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best option is to point your nameservers to Wix. Pointing nameservers is recommended as Wix will then control all of your DNS records including email. If you want to only host your site at Wix and continue hosting email at DreamHost, you must point A records instead.</p>

<h2>Can I export my Wix site to DreamHost?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No, you cannot. Sites created at Wix can only be accessed within their hosting environment. It's not possible to log in to their servers to see the code as it is with DreamHost. As such, you cannot export a Wix site to a different hosting provider.</p>
