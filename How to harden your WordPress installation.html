<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure your admin user is not named <strong>admin</strong>.</p>
<p>If your admin user is named ‘admin’, create a new user with some other name and give it admin privileges. After you have confirmed that this account works, log in as this account and return to the left-hand users tab and delete the account user named ‘admin’.</p>
<p>This is very important as ‘admin’ is the most commonly attacked username. View the following article for further information:</p>

<p>To prevent your password from being transmitted in the clear, you must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">add an SSL certificate</a> to your site. This enables you to connect using an encrypted and secure connection.&nbsp;View the following article for details on how to use an SSL certificate with WordPress.</p>

<p>Even if a plugin or theme is inactive, it could still pose a security risk. If you're not using a theme or plugin, make sure to delete it from your web server. Plugins and themes are located in the following directory. Make sure to change the&nbsp;<span class="text-object">username</span> to your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access" target="_self">Shell user</a>.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/<span class="code-highlight">username/example.com</span>/wp-content/</pre>
</div>
<p>Inside of that <span class="text-object">/wp-content</span> folder, navigate into the <span class="text-object">/plugins</span> or <span class="text-object">/themes</span> directory and delete any that you do not use.</p>
<p>The same goes for extra installs of WordPress. For example, it's possible that a test site was created under <strong>example.com/wptest</strong>. Or maybe you had an old site but no longer use it. In any case, if you have another WordPress install that you're not using, delete it.</p>
<p>Finally, if you have any other applications such as Joomla, Drupal, or Moodle installed under your user that you're not using, make sure to remove those as well.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The bottom line is that if you're not using the software installed under your user, it's best to remove it. Only keep what you need.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can use an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess</a> file to further protect your site. For example, the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214693268-WordPress-wp-config-php-overview">wp-config.php</a> should never be publicly accessible. To protect this file, add the following to an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file in your site's directory where all other WordPress files are located:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;Files wp-config.php&gt;
order allow,deny
deny from all
&lt;/Files&gt;</pre>
