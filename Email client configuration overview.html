<p>This article shows how to set up an address that is hosted at DreamHost. If you are hosting your email at a different company, you must consult their documentation for the settings mentioned below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="Username_and_password">Step 1 — Add the email address to the panel</span></h2>
<p>You can create your email address through your <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> page.</p>
<p>View the following article for detailed instructions on how to add an email address:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215029918-How-do-I-add-an-email-address-">How do I add an email address?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2 — Locate your username and password</h2>
<p>Once you create an email address, you will have your Username and Password.</p>
<h3>Username</h3>
<p>This is the part before your domain. For example <strong>username</strong>@example.com.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>Your email client may only require this first part of the email address, but it's possible that your email client may need the full email address to connect. This depends on your mail client.</em></dd>
</dl>
<h3>Password</h3>
<p>The password for the user is what you chose when creating the address.</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>The Password can be changed at any time through your </em><a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a><em> page or through the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217133137">Mailboxes</a> interface. View the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216479177-Change-password-Mail-users-">Change password</a>' article for details.</em></dd>

<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<ul>
<li>The Username/Password Authentication setting must be enabled and set to ‘Password’.</li>
<li>Passwords are CaSe SeNsItIvE!</li>
<li>Passwords for your email users can be changed at anytime.</li>
<li>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216479147-Passwords-overview">Passwords</a> article to help choose a strong password.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="Server_names">Step 3 — Locate your mail servername</span></h2>
<p>Your server name (aka hostname) controls where your email is sent from and sent to. The following are the only hostnames you should use to connect to your email. View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215612887-Email-client-protocols-and-port-numbers">IMAP or POP address and enabling secure ports</a> article to determine if you'd prefer to use an IMAP or POP connection.</p>
<h3>Incoming</h3>
<p><strong>IMAP hostname</strong>: imap.dreamhost.com</p>
<p><strong>POP hostname</strong>: pop.dreamhost.com</p>
<h3>Outgoing</h3>
<p>smtp.dreamhost.com</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) require that you use their SMTP server to send mail (example: smtp.yourISP.com). You must check with your ISP to see if they require you to use their SMTP server for outgoing mail, or if you can use your domain's mail server for outgoing mail.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Step 4 — Set secure ports and choose IMAP or POP</h2>
<p>Many modern email clients automatically enable secure ports during your configuration. This means you may not even be asked for this information. However, some email clients require you to specifically add these details. </p>
<p>If your client asks for port numbers, you'll need to know which ones to enter. Some ports are insecure while others are secure. The port numbers you choose also dictate if your address uses an IMAP or POP connection.</p>
<p>When choosing a port, only secure port settings are recommended. When choosing between POP and IMAP, you'll want to choose IMAP unless you have a specific reason to use POP.</p>
<p>View the following articles for details on which secure port settings you should use:</p>

</ul>
<h2>MX records</h2>
<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215032408-What-is-an-MX-record-">MX records</a> are the DNS records that tell other mail servers how to find your email address on the internet.</p>
<p>Only after you create your first email address are <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215032408-What-is-an-MX-record-">MX records</a> created for your domain. It takes about 4-6hrs for them to be set up after the first address is added, so you must wait that long to use the first email address. After that there is no delay when adding an email address.</p>

<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If your website and email are hosted at DreamHost, you don't need to worry about these records.</p>
<p>Only if your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are hosted at another company would you need to point your MX records to DreamHost.</p>
