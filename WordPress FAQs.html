<p>Automatic updates for One-Click WordPress installations will update the core WordPress installation whenever a new major release is available, and will also update any plugins that are available at that time. However, automatic update will <em>not</em> update your theme, since doing so would overwrite any customizations you've made to it. Instead, you are responsible for updating your theme.</p>
