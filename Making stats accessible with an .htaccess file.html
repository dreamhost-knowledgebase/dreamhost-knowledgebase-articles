<p>Site statistics are not available on DreamPress plans (excluding older DreamPress Legacy plans). Be sure to enable <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115006051887-Using-Jetpack-with-DreamPress">Jetpack</a> if you wish to capture site statistics on your DreamPress site.</p>
</div>
<p>Many CMS and blog applications generate their own <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess</a> file that makes DreamHost stats unreachable. To correct this situation, you need to edit your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>This problem does not apply to a WordPress blog installed in a subdirectory on your server. For example, a blog at <span class="text-object">example.com/</span> will be affected, but a blog at <span class="text-object">example.com/blog/</span> will not be.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>An <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file is a plain text file. As such, there are many different ways to edit the file. The easiest way is to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP">edit the file using an FTP client</a>. In that client, make sure the ability to view <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-do-I-show-hidden-files-on-my-FTP-client-">hidden files</a> is enabled. This allows you to see files beginning with a period which you can then edit and save by using your client.</p>
<p>A better way to edit an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file is to connect to your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> and open the file up in a text editor. A good choice is a text editor called nano. You can then simply make your changes and re-save it.</p>
<p>View the following article for details on how to edit a file via SSH:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Other text editors</h3>
<p>Long term, you may want to find a text editor you can use to edit files on your own computer that gives you an option to save with 'Unix-style' line endings. This enables you to use FTP to copy the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file to your computer, edit it with familiar tools, and then place it back onto the server (again via FTP).</p>
<p>For the Macintosh, Bare Bones BBEdit (or the free Textwrangler) is regarded as the best text editor to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.barebones.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">barebones.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows-based PCs, a popular text editor that many use is Notepad++:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good text editors are available for just about any platform. Many are "free" and/or open source and can be easily located via a Google search.</p>

<h2><span id="What_to_change_in_the_.htaccess_file">What to change in the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once you've opened the file in nano (or another text editor), you'll need to update it using the information below.</p>
<p>Your "standard" WordPress <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file looks something like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"># BEGIN WordPress<br /># The directives (lines) between `BEGIN WordPress` and `END WordPress` are<br /># dynamically generated, and should only be modified via WordPress filters.<br /># Any changes to the directives between these markers will be overwritten.
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_FILENAME}&nbsp;!-f
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_FILENAME}&nbsp;!-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# END WordPress 
</pre>
</div>
<p>To allow the <span class="text-object">/stats</span> directory to be displayed properly on DreamHost, you need to add the following lines to your .htaccess before the section added by WordPress:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ErrorDocument 401 "Error"
ErrorDocument 403 "Error"

&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt; 
</pre>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The lines used in the above example are self contained, so you can put them at the beginning of any <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file to fix stats and won't interfere with other .htaccess operations.</li>
<li>The above entries work with Drupal as well (added above your standard Drupal <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file code).</li>
</ul>
<p>The final <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file for WordPress would look like:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ErrorDocument 401 "Error"
ErrorDocument 403 "Error"

&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt; 
<br /># BEGIN WordPress<br /># The directives (lines) between `BEGIN WordPress` and `END WordPress` are<br /># dynamically generated, and should only be modified via WordPress filters.<br /># Any changes to the directives between these markers will be overwritten.
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_FILENAME}&nbsp;!-f
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_FILENAME}&nbsp;!-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# END WordPress
</pre>

<p>If this doesn't seem to initially work for you, remember to clear your cache. Visit the following article for further details:</p>

</ul>
<p>To get your stats working in Ruby on Rails or Joomla, add the following to the top of the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file (located in the <span class="text-object">/public</span> directory of your Rails app or root directory of your Joomla web site):</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond&nbsp;%{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Unfortunately, if you are using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215769578-Passenger-overview">Phusion Passenger</a> to deploy your Ruby on Rails application, stats are not available from the web because Passenger overrides the behavior of the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file. It is recommended that you use a third-party stats package.</p>
