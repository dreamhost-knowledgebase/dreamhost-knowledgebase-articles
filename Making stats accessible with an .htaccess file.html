<p>Many CMS and blog applications generate their own <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess</a> file that makes DreamHost stats unreachable. These include <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089938-What-One-Click-Installs-does-DreamHost-offer-">One-Click Install</a> applications such as WordPress, Joomla, and Textpattern. Drupal also produces its own .htaccess file as well. To correct this situation, you need to edit your .htaccess file.</p>

<p>This problem does not apply to a WordPress blog installed in a subdirectory on your server. For example, a blog at example.com/ will be affected, but a blog at example.com/blog/ will not be.</p>

<h2><span id="Editing_an_.htaccess_file">Editing an .htaccess file</span></h2>
<p>An .htaccess file is a plain text file. As such, there are many different ways to edit the file. The easiest way is to use an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215612917-FTP-overview">FTP</a> client. In that client, make sure the ability to view <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-do-I-show-hidden-files-on-my-FTP-client-">hidden files</a> is enabled. This allows you to see files beginning with a period which you can then edit and save by using your client.</p>
<p>A better way to edit an .htaccess file is to connect to your server via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> and open the file up in a text editor. A good choice is a text editor called ‘nano’. You can then simply make your changes and re-save it.</p>
<p>For example, run this in your site’s directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">nano .htaccess</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This opens the file to edit. When finished editing, click CTRL + X and ENTER to save.</p>
<p>Long term, you may want to find a text editor you can use to edit files on your own computer that gives you an option to save with 'Unix-style' line endings. This enables you to use FTP to copy the .htaccess file to your computer, edit it with familiar tools, and then place it back onto the server (again via FTP).</p>
<p>For the Macintosh, Bare Bones BBEdit (or the free Textwrangler) is regarded as the best text editor to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external free" href="http://www.barebones.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.barebones.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For Windows-based PCs, a popular text editor that many use is Notepad++:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="external free" href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" rel="nofollow">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Good text editors are available for just about any platform. Many are "free" and/or open source and can be easily located via a Google search.</p>
<h2><span id="What_to_change_in_the_.htaccess_file">What to change in the .htaccess file</span></h2>
<p>Your "standard" WordPress .htaccess file looks something like this (since WordPress 3.0 according to the <a class=" " href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Creating_and_editing_.28.htaccess.29" rel="nofollow">codex</a>):</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"># BEGIN WordPress
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# END WordPress 
</pre>
</div>
<p>To allow the "stats" directory to be displayed properly on DreamHost, you need to add the following lines to your .htaccess before the section added by WordPress:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ErrorDocument 401 "Error"
ErrorDocument 403 "Error"

&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt; 
</pre>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The lines used in the above example are self contained, so you can put them at the beginning of any .htaccess file to fix stats and won't interfere with other .htaccess operations.</li>
<li>The above entries work with Drupal as well (added above your standard Drupal .htaccess file code).</li>
</ul>
<p>The final .htaccess file for WordPress would look like:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ErrorDocument 401 "Error"
ErrorDocument 403 "Error"

&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt; 

# BEGIN WordPress
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
# END WordPress
</pre>
</div>
<p>If this doesn't seem to initially work for you, remember to clear your cache. Visit the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216456827-How-to-clear-your-browser-s-cache">Clear cache</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The same basic idea works for Textpattern. Here's a sample .htaccess for Textpattern.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
# DreamHost stats
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]

# Textpattern
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^(.+) - [PT,L]
RewriteRule . /index.php
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>To get your stats working in Ruby on Rails or Joomla add the following to the top of the .htaccess file (located in the "public" directory of your Rails app or root directory of your Joomla web site):</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(stats|failed_auth\.html).*$ [NC]
RewriteRule . - [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img alt="" height="60" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Unfortunately, if you are using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215769578-Passenger-overview">Phusion Passenger</a> to deploy your Ruby on Rails application, stats are not available from the web because Passenger overrides the behavior of the .htaccess file. It is recommended that you use a third-party stats package.</p>
