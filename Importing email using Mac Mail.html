<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article assumes you've already exported your email within Mac Mail using the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001191406-Exporting-email-using-MacMail">Exporting email using MacMail</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's also assumed you backed up your email from another hosting company and are now ready to import your email into your DreamHost email account.</p>
</div><h2>Importing</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Before continuing, delete the old email account from MacMail that was connected to your old hosting provider.</li>
<li>Add the address back to MacMail, but this time make sure it connects to your DreamHost mail server. View the following article for instructions:

</ul>
</li>
<li>At this point, MacMail should load your address at DreamHost. There should be no email in this account since you have not migrated anything yet.

<li>In the left pane you'll see the 'Import' folder. Click this to reveal all sub-folders and emails you just imported. As mentioned in the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001191406-Exporting-email-using-MacMail">Exporting email using Mac Mail</a>' article, the emails are backed up in 'mbox' files. You'll see above that under each folder is another folder titled 'mbox'. This is where your emails reside.</li>
</ol>
</div><h2>Moving email into your new address</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At this point, email is in Mac Mail under the 'Import' section. You must now drag those emails into your DreamHost address. This requires you to create folders as you go along and drag the contents of each folder individually.</p>
<h3>Moving email into your Inbox</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, click the 'mbox' folder for your Inbox. </li>
<li>You'll see its content populate to the right.
<dl>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Click your Inbox folder and you'll see all emails have been imported.</li>

<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-08_macmail_importing_email_10.png"/></dd>
</dl>
</li>
