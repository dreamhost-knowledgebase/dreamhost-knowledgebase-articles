<p>DreamHost provides an option to entirely close an account when only a Shared hosting plan is active. If a DreamHost account has VPS services and/or Dedicated services without a Shared hosting plan, refer instead to the 'See also' links below.</p>
<p>This article assumes that since you're canceling your only hosting plan, you no longer wish to have your website hosted at DreamHost, but wish to keep the account open for your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>.</p>
<h2>Viewing your hosting plan type</h2>
<p>You can view all services billed to your account on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account&amp;">(Panel &gt; 'Billing &amp; Account' &gt; 'Manage Account')</a> page. Here you'll see a list of all services you currently use.</p>
<h2>Closing your Shared hosting account</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=billing.accounts">Panel &gt; 'Billing &amp; Account' &gt; 'Manage Account'</a>) page.
