<h2 id="h_01HF7JHY94G0QX8QSHEXZ9WMFD">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="h_01HF7JHY949Z0FKX56VD4EZMSD">Is HTTP/2 available on all hosting plans?</h3>
<p>Yes. <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> is currently supported on all managed hosting platforms (Shared, DreamPress, VPS, and Dedicated).</p>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01HF7JHY94KSCPG8D54RV73FPQ">What benefits does HTTP/2 provide?</h3>
<p><span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> brings a number of new features to the table, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A binary protocol, making it more compact to ship over the wire</li>
<li>Fully multiplexed, parallel connections allow for faster, more efficient data transfer</li>
<li>Server push functionality, which allows web designers to build sites that proactively send assets that are needed by a web page</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HF7JHY94KY2D0DFFHT7V8VR9">Will my site be compatible with HTTP/2?</h3>
<p>Yes! Browsers that support <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> will automatically use the newer protocol when connecting to an <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> webserver; browsers that don’t support <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> will seamlessly use <span class="text-object">HTTP/1.1</span>, just as they currently do now. Websites won't display any differently over <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> than over <span class="text-object">HTTP/1.1</span>, apart from potential performance increases and faster loading times.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HF7JHY94MMZ2XQSTPCFJ176F">Is my TLS certificate compatible over HTTP/2?</h3>
<p>Yes. Your current <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360022370112-Comodo-name-change-to-Sectigo">Sectigo</a>, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216539558-Let-s-Encrypt-SSL-certificate-overview">Let’s Encrypt</a>, or third-party TLS certificate will work out of the box over <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HF7JHY94C02B9T5KV8S4E6RS">Can I use HTTP/2 for non-secured hosting domains?</h3>
<p>At this time, only secured hosting domains with a TLS certificate support <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span>. This is largely due to the current browser implementation landscape; there are no browsers currently supporting <span class="text-object">HTTP/2</span> connections over cleartext.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HF7JHY94A6BPX5H77M6RY19S">HTTP/2 does not appear to be enabled for my site</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This should only happen if you are on a VPS or Dedicated Server running an older operating system, or if you are running your own custom Apache installation. <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact support</a> if you are uncertain.</p>
