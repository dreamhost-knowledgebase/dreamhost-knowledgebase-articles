<p>Convenience Addresses are email addresses that can be created so your list users can use ’listname@example.com’ for the list, rather than ’listname@lists.example.com’. Thus, the ‘lists.’ subdomain is removed in these convenience addresses.</p>
<p>Each ‘listname-action@lists.example.com’ has two forward-only convenience addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘listname-action@example.com‘</li>
<li>‘listname-example.com-action@lists.example.com‘</li>
</ul>
<p>Convenience addresses are listed as forward-only addresses in the panel's (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Manage Email‘</a>) page. However, you should only create or remove them by using the ‘Add/Delete convenience email addresses set up for this list‘ checkbox in the panel's (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.discussion&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Mail’ &gt; ‘Discussion List‘</a>) page. Editing the convenience addresses using the ‘Manage Email‘ page may cause problems that only DreamHost support can correct.</p>
<h2>Example of convenience addresses</h2>
<p>The following screenshot shows convenience addresses created on a list named test@lists.websitehelp.support. Note how the first column of addresses does not contain the ‘lists.’ subdomain, but all addresses in this first column forward to the corresponding list email address:</p>
