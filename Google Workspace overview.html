<p>Google is changing the name of its G Suite product to Google Workspace.</p>
<p>If you are currently on a DreamHost G Suite plan, DreamHost will contact you soon with more information on how to transition to Google Workspace. You can also visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360028979651-Changing-your-Google-Workspace-plan-type">Change Plan</a> page to manually transition.</p>
<p>Most of the core services (including all of its collaboration tools like Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Chat, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, Sites, and more), functionality, and pricing between older G Suite and Google Workspace plans remain the same. See the following Google Workspace article for more information:</p>

</ul>
<p>One major difference between G Suite and Google Workspace is related to the "Vault" feature. This is now available only on Google Workspace's new <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028697631-Google-Workspace-plans" target="_self">Business Plus plan</a>. Business Plus includes several enhanced features over Business Standard, such as 250 participant video meetings, 5 TB cloud storage per user, eDiscovery and retention rules, advanced endpoint management â€“ and Vault.</p>
