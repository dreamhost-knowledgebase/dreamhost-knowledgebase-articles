<p>Effective December 1, 2016, ICANN is revising its Transfer Policy. Any change made to the registrant's name, organization, or email address will put the domain in a 60-day transfer lock; it will also trigger notification emails that are sent to the old and new registrant notifying them of the change.</p>
<p>Please visit the following article for further details:</p>

<p>When a domain expires, most TLDs allow a 30-day renewal grace period where you can renew the domain at the standard cost. Once that grace period expires, the domain is placed into another 30-day period called redemption with the current registrar that issued DreamHost the license for the domain.</p>
<p>The redemption period, for most TLDs, lasts another 30 days. During this time, you have one more chance to redeem the domain name, but this will cost an additional fee to the registrar to process the redemption.</p>
<p>If you would still like to retrieve the domain in this stage, you must pay the amount that the registrar charges to redeem it. To view the redemption fee chart, please visit the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/domain-registration-terms/">Domain Registration Terms</a> page for further details. Then, you must pay for the standard yearly registration cost.</p>
<p>To redeem a domain name during the redemption period, click the <strong>‘Redeem this domain!’</strong> button through the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Registrations’</a>) page on your account panel. This prompts you to pay for the redemption cost before you can complete this process.</p>
<p>The redemption needs some time to process. Please allow up to 30 minutes and if the domain is not redeemed and renewed at that time, feel free to contact DreamHost support for assistance in your panel at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Contact Support’</a>).</p>
