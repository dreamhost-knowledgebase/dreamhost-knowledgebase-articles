<p>There are several manual methods of backing up the contents for your account. The following is a description of the various backup and service options:</p>
<h2>Backing up via FTP</h2>

<p>If you have several GB of data, DreamHost recommends compressing the directories first and then downloading the contents to speed things up. This is done by logging into your web server through your SHELL user, and then manually zipping the folders.
