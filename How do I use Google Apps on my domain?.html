<p>Google Apps gives everyone at your organization a custom email address, tools for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, a shared calendaring system, and access to a flexible extranet system (standalone security and compliance services are also available). DreamHost offers an easy method for integrating Google Apps with your domain and even handles setting up all the DNS records for the domain to make their services function.</p>

<p>Everything else regarding these services must be managed in Google's control panel. Once you've made the changes in your DreamHost panel, log into Google's control panel <a href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/">here</a> to sign up and start managing your site with them.</p>

<h2><span id="Step_two:_Enabling_Google_Apps_for_your_domain">Step two: Enabling Google Apps for your domain</span></h2>
<p>Once you’ve registered for Google Apps and created a Google account for your domain as described above, there are two ways to enable it in your DreamHost panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) page, or</li>
<li>On the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Mail' &gt; 'Custom MX'</a>) page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods produce the same result, so it’s completely up to you which one you use. But remember, it is strongly recommended that you perform this process during a convenient downtime window since email delivery may be disrupted and your users may need to change their email client settings.</p>

<p>When you enable Google Apps on your domain, your old DreamHost email addresses for that domain remain functional, but previously stored emails may not be retained. Be sure to backup all your stored emails before switching. You can view the following article for more information:</p>
