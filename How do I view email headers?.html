<p>Every email sent or received has a set of headers that are applied to that message. These headers of the email consist of important details such as who sent the message, at what time and to whom it was sent. The headers for the sent message and the received message will be different. The sent headers will have much less information since the message was sent, so it will not trace the hops the message took to get delivered to the final destination. The headers on the received email will show the complete journey the message took, starting from the sender details to the final recipient.</p>
<p>When submitting requests to DreamHost support regarding mail issues with sending and receiving, they will often request this information from you so they are able to confirm what happened during the transport of the message.</p>
