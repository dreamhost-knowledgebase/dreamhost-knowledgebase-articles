<h2 id="h_01HPQKGTS1Q137YV596N0N2RMA">Importing a list of subscribers</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.list&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announcement Lists</a> page.</li>
<li>Create a new list, or click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of an existing list.</li>
<li>In the box titled 'Emails to Add:', paste in a list of all emails (one per line) you wish to import.</li>
<li>When finished, click the&nbsp;<strong>Modify Subscribers...</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>All subscribers to all Announcement Lists must confirm their intention to subscribe. So, when you paste in this list, you'll first be emailing all of them a message (which you can customize) explaining that you've moved your list provider and will need everybody who wants to keep receiving the list to re-confirm their subscription. Then, they'll only need to click a link in that email in order to do so.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HPQKGTS2K8DDXQJ3KG2J5ANJ">Exporting a list of subscribers</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The only way to do this is to cut and paste the subscribers in your panel into a text editor, and then save the file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.list&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announcement Lists</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of an existing list.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <span class="text-section">Current subscriber list</span> section.</li>
<li>Select which information you'd like displayed for each user.</li>
<li>Copy all information in the text field to a text editor such as <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll then have a list in a plain text file of all of your email subscribers.</p>
