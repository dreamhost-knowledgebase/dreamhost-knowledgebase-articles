<p>The following describes how to install WordPress from your DreamHost panel. It also details the extras features you receive if you choose the free 'Deluxe' install.</p>
<h2>Before installing</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before installing WordPress, check what files are already in your website's directory.</p>
<h3>If there are existing WordPress files</h3>
<p>If there are any existing WordPress files in it, they will be renamed with a string of numbers at the end. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>index.php.1353108851</li>
</ul>
<h3>If there are non-WordPress files in your directory</h3>
<p>If there are any non-WordPress files or directories, these will not be touched by the installation. The new WordPress files will be installed along side your existing files.</p>
</div>
<h2>Installing WordPress</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Install to: </strong>Select the domain you'd like to install into. The second textbox is if you want to install into a subdirectory (if you do not want it stored in the primary directory). For example, if you want it installed into&nbsp;<strong>example.com/blog</strong> first select <strong>example.com</strong> in the first dropdown menu. In the second textbox type in <strong>blog</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Select Database: </strong>You probably want 'Automatically Create Database' since this creates a new unique database for your site. You can also choose an existing database if you like.</li>
<li><strong>Deluxe Install: </strong>It's recommended you check this box if you would like the extra features mentioned below. This is a free addition to your install.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Install it for me now!</strong> button. Within 15 minutes, an email is sent to you at the primary email listed on your DreamHost account. This email details further steps to take to complete the installation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>How to log into your WordPress site</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've installed WordPress, you'll receive an email to the primary email address on your DreamHost account. This email lists further steps to take to complete the installation.</p>
<p>When WordPress is finally running on your site, you can log into it at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>example.com/wp-login.php</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>The Deluxe Install</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The free Deluxe Install features several important customizations to make it easy for beginners to get started, including free and open source themes from Automattic, a standard selection of plugins, and a security enhancement.</p>
<h3><span id="Themes">Themes</span></h3>
<p>As of June 2018, Deluxe Installs include the following selection of free and open source themes from Automattic:</p>
<ul>
<li>argent</li>
<li>button</li>
<li>dyad</li>
<li>illustratr</li>
<li>kelly</li>
<li>libre</li>
<li>orvis</li>
<li>resonar</li>
<li>scrawl</li>
<li>sketch</li>
<li>twentyfifteen (also present in regular installs)</li>
<li>twentyseventeen (also present in regular installs)</li>
<li>twentysixteen (also present in regular installs)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Plugins">Plugins</span></h3>
<p>DreamHost's One-Click Install also includes the following popular plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">Akismet</a> (also present in regular installs)</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> (automatically enabled by default)</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/">WPForms Lite</a> (automatically enabled by default)</li>
</ul>
<p>Though these plugins are installed by default for Deluxe installations, you may need activate them in your WordPress dashboard by going to ‘Plugins' &gt; 'Installed Plugins’.</p>
<h3><span id="Security_enhancement">Security enhancement</span></h3>
<p>Additionally, the One-Click Deluxe Install adds protection against the execution of scripts within your uploads directory.</p>
<p>In more technical terms, this means an .htaccess file with the following contents is automatically added to your /wp-content/uploads/ directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">### Generated by DreamHost. DO NOT modify!!! ###
SetHandler no-handler
################################################</pre>
</div>
<p>If your site is compromised through the placing of a malicious script in your uploads directory, the script is returned as a download when accessed. This keeps the script from running and helps to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>DreamHost will continue to add additional security enhancements as they become available.</p>
</div>
