<p>This article explains how to install WordPress from your DreamHost panel. It also details the extras you'll receive if you choose the free 'Deluxe' install.</p>
<h2>Installing WordPress</h2>
<ol>
<li>To install WordPress at DreamHost, log into your panel and go to the Goodies section at (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.installer&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Goodies’ &gt; ‘One-Click Installs’</a>).</li>

</dl>
</li>
<li>Enter the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Install to: </strong>Select the domain you'd like to install into. The second textbox is if you want to install into a subdirectory (if you do not want it stored in the primary directory). For example, if you want it installed into <strong>example.com/blog</strong> first select <strong>example.com</strong> in the first dropdown menu. In the second textbox type in <strong>blog</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Select Database: </strong>You probably want 'Automatically Create Database' since this creates a new unique database for your site. You can also choose an existing database if you like.</li>
<li><strong>Deluxe Install: </strong>It's recommended you check this box if you would like the extra features mentioned below. This is a free addition to your install.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Install it for me now!</strong>. You'll then receive an email to the primary email listed on your DreamHost account. This email details further steps to take to complete the installation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Deluxe install</h2>
<p>The free Deluxe install comes with a few choice customizations to make it easy for beginners to get started such as free, open source themes from Automattic, a standard selection of plugins, and a security enhancement.</p>
<h3><span id="Themes">Themes</span></h3>
<p>Includes a selection of free, open source, themes from Automattic.</p>
<h3><span id="Plugins">Plugins</span></h3>
<p>DreamHost's One-Click Install also includes the following popular plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/">Akismet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">JetPack</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/">wpforms-lite</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Though these plugins are installed by default for deluxe installations, you may need activate them in your WordPress dashboard by going to ‘Plugins’ &gt; ‘Installed Plugins’.</p>
<h3><span id="Security_enhancement">Security enhancement</span></h3>
<p>Additionally, this One-Click install adds protection against execution of scripts within your uploads directory.</p>
<p>In more technical terms, this means an .htaccess file with the following contents, within your /wp-content/uploads/ directory, is automatically added:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">### Generated by DreamHost. DO NOT modify!!! ###
SetHandler no-handler
################################################</pre>
</div>
<p>If your site is compromised through the placing of a malicious script in your uploads directory, the script is returned as a download when accessed. This keeps the script from running and helps to prevent further damage.</p>
<p>In the future, DreamHost will add additional security enhancements as well.</p>
<h2>How to log into your WordPress site</h2>
<p>After you've installed WordPress, you'll receive an email to the primary email address on your DreamHost account. This email lists further steps to take to complete the installation.</p>
<p>When WordPress is finally running on your site, you can log into it at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>example.com/wp-login.php</strong></li>
</ul>
