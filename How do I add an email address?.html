<p>You must have an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437#email_hosting">active hosting plan</a>, or a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024060072-Paid-email-plan">paid email add-on plan</a> to use email.</p>
<p>All hosting plans except Starter Shared offer email for free.</p>

<p>In the past, it was possible to create a fully hosted email that also forwarded to another inbox. This feature is no longer supported, and any new email addresses created will not have this option. Existing email addresses using this feature will remain unaffected until they are edited, at which time you will need to select between forward only or fully hosted.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A fully hosted email address is an email address that has an active mailbox to log into for sending and receiving messages. These fully hosted email users will have access to their own mailbox, as well as access to the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216540008-webmail-overview">Webmail</a> interface and the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217133137-The-Mailboxes-interface">Mailboxes</a> interface. You can set these users up on third party mail programs as well if you do not wish to access your mailbox through the Webmail interface.</p>

<p>If this is the first email user created for the domain, the MX record and the other mail records will be set for the domain once the user has been created. This will require up to 6 hours for the DNS to resolve for each mail record. Because of this, the user will not be accessible until the DNS has updated.</p>

<h2>Deleting an email address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To delete an email address in the panel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button to the right of your email address.</li>
<li>When prompted, select 'Ok' to confirm the deletion request.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2><span id="Sending_and_receiving_email_using_your_new_email_address">How long does it take a new email address to function?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>By default, your domain is not set up with MX (mail hosting) records with DreamHost when the domain is set to be hosted. The MX records and all other mail hosting records are applied to the domain once the first email address is created.</p>
<p>After you’ve created your email address (and if this is the first email address created under the domain) the domain will need some time for the mail record DNS to propagate, which can take up to 6 hours for each record.</p>
<p>If your domain is already configured with the records for mail hosting, the newly created user should be fully active within 15 minutes of it being created.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Sending_and_receiving_email_using_your_new_email_address">Sending and receiving email using your new email address</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Below are the records that are configured once the first user is created:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><strong>_domainkey (dkim)</strong></li>
<li><strong>_autodiscover (srv)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mail. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mail. (MX)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mail. (MX)</strong></li>
<li><strong>mailboxes. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.mailboxes. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>webmail. (A)</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.webmail. (A)</strong></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are two MX records for the domain’s mail hosting along with the records for the subdomains for Mailboxes and Webmail. Each record can resolve at different times, so one service may be active while another has yet to update.</p>
<p>During this time, messages sent to your user will be rejected with a bounce notification containing the error below:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>“Recipient Address Rejected”</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>Until the DNS resolves, the messages sent to your user will continue to be rejected. However, your user should be able to send messages out even when the DNS has yet to resolve. This often causes confusion as to why a user can send, but cannot receive emails. Give it a bit more time for the DNS to resolve before the new user can receive incoming mail.</p>
<p>To send and receive emails, DreamHost offers the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216540008-webmail-overview">Webmail interface</a> by default. This can be accessed once the DNS resolves for the webmail record. You can access the Webmail interface with the following URL: <a href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="Internet_standards_email_addresses">Internet standards email addresses</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Internet standards specify some email addresses that all domains should have and use for standard purposes. There's no Internet police that will punish you for not having them, but having these email addresses is not too much trouble and can help avoid problems.</p>
