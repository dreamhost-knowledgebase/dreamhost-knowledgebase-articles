<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article provides information about database merges and the process taken when a database merge is scheduled in the DreamHost panel.</p>
<h2><span id="Why_is_this_an_issue.3F">Why is this an issue?</span></h2>
<p>Most often, your database services are always on a single database server. However, it’s possible that you may have databases split across two different database servers. It’s highly recommended to only use a single database server, as this makes troubleshooting any database-related issue much easier as well as making it simpler to access all of your databases from a single set of user and hostnames.</p>

<h2><span id="Moving_your_databases">Moving your databases</span></h2>
<p>When you click the <strong>Move my databases!</strong> button, the migration does not begin immediately. Generally, these merges are performed in the middle of the night (PST).</p>
<p>You are also given an opportunity to cancel the process if you choose not to proceed with the migration.</p>
<p>After clicking the button, a message appears informing you that this migration will take several hours to complete and that your site may not work properly during this process.</p>
<p>When the migration is finished, you will be emailed a confirmation.</p>
<h2><span id="What_to_expect">What to expect</span></h2>
<p>At or after midnight, an automated script runs and consolidates your databases onto one server. Once the move is successful, a notification is sent to your email address.</p>
<p>If it takes more than a few hours, the script may have had some kind of problem and you should contact support for further assistance:</p>
