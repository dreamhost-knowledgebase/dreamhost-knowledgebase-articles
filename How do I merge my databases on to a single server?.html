<p>This article provides information about database merges and the process taken when a database merge is scheduled in the DreamHost panel.</p>
<h2><span id="Why_is_this_an_issue.3F" class="mw-headline">Why is this an issue?</span></h2>
<p>Most often, your database services are always on a single database server. However, it’s possible that you may have databases split across two different database servers. It’s highly recommended to only use a single database server, as this makes troubleshooting any database-related issue much easier as well as making it simpler to access all of your databases from a single set of user and hostnames.</p>

<h2><span id="Moving_your_databases" class="mw-headline">Moving your databases</span></h2>
<p>When you click the <strong>Move my databases!</strong> button, the migration does not begin immediately. Generally, these merges are performed in the middle of the night (PST).</p>
<p>You are also given an opportunity to cancel the process if you choose not to proceed with the migration.</p>
<p><em>The following status message appears after you click the button:</em></p>
<p class="exampletext">Moving databases is not an instantaneous process. <br />Based on the size of your databases, it can take up to several hours to complete. <br />You will receive an email at (YourEmailAddress) when the move begins and another when it is completed. <br />During the move: your sites that use moving databases may not work properly.</p>
<p><em>After choosing to proceed, the following message appears:</em></p>

<h2><span id="What_to_expect" class="mw-headline">What to expect</span></h2>
<p>At or after midnight, an automated script runs and consolidates your databases onto one server. Once the move is successful, a notification is sent to your email address.</p>
<p>If it takes more than a few hours, the script may have had some kind of problem and you should contact support for further assistance:</p>
