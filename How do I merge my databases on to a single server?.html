<p>This article provides information about database merges and the process taken when a database merge is scheduled in the DreamHost panel.</p>
<h2><span id="Why_is_this_an_issue.3F">Why is this an issue?</span></h2>
<p>Most often, your database services are always on a single database server. However, it’s possible that you may have databases split across two different database servers. It’s highly recommended to only use a single database server, as this makes troubleshooting any database-related issue much easier as well as making it simpler to access all of your databases from a single set of user and hostnames.</p>

<h2><span id="Moving_your_databases">Moving your databases</span></h2>
<p>When you click the <strong>Move my databases!</strong> button, the migration does not begin immediately. Generally, these merges are performed in the middle of the night (PST).</p>
<p>You are also given an opportunity to cancel the process if you choose not to proceed with the migration.</p>
<p><em>The following status message appears after you click the button:</em></p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Moving databases is not an instantaneous process.
Based on the size of your databases, it can take up to several hours to complete.
You will receive an email at (YourEmailAddress) when the move begins and another when it is completed.
During the move: your sites that use moving databases may not work properly.</pre>
</div>
<p><em>After choosing to proceed, the following message appears:</em></p>

<h2><span id="What_to_expect">What to expect</span></h2>
<p>At or after midnight, an automated script runs and consolidates your databases onto one server. Once the move is successful, a notification is sent to your email address.</p>
<p>If it takes more than a few hours, the script may have had some kind of problem and you should contact support for further assistance:</p>
