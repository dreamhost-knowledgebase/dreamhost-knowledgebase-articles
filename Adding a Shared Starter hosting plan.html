<h2>What is a Shared&nbsp;Starter hosting plan?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Shared Starter is DreamHost's most basic entry-level hosting plan.</p>
<p>The Shared Starter plan is an excellent option to get a single website up and running quickly at a very low cost. Since it's a starter plan, there are a few limitations to be aware of which are all mentioned below.</p>

<h2>Does DreamHost offer other hosting plans?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In addition to a Shared Starter plan, the following hosting plans are also available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared — your site is hosted on a shared server</li>
