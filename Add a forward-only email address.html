<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A forward-only email address is an email address that does not have an active mailbox. This is because this userâ€™s primary function is to forward all emails sent to it to another email user. The message will only be stored on the user that is set to receive the forwarded email.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> set an active email address to a forward-only address. This will delete all emails previously saved under this address.</p>
