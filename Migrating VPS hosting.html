<h3>Upgrading to a Dedicated server</h3>
<p>If you'd like to migrate all of the content on your VPS to a Dedicated server, you must first purchase the Dedicated server as shown in the following article:</p>

</ul>
<p>During that process, select your VPS in the dropdown to migrate all data. Once everything has been migrated, you can then delete your VPS:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Upgrading to DreamPress</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to upgrade an existing WordPress site to DreamPress.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you only had the single WordPress site on your VPS, you can then cancel it.</p>

<p>If you have other sites on the VPS, you must continue paying for that plan since only the single site would have been migrated to DreamPress.</p>
