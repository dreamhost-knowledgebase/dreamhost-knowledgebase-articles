<h3>Downgrading to Shared</h3>
<p>First, make sure you've added a Shared Hosting plan.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001371926-Adding-a-Shared-hosting-plan-to-your-domain-only-account" target="_self" rel="undefined">Adding a Shared Hosting plan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can then delete the Private Server.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003876392-Delete-a-VPS" target="_self">Delete a VPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When deleting, you will see a message informing you that everything on the VPS will be migrated to the shared server.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you have both a shared and dedicated server on your account, only the dedicated server will show as an option to migrate to when deleting your VPS.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to migrate to a shared server, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">contact support</a>. DreamHost support will then migrate the data for you.</p>

<h3>Upgrading to a Dedicated Server</h3>
<p>If you'd like to migrate all of the content on your VPS to a Dedicated Server, you must first purchase the Dedicated Server as shown in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945457-Add-a-Dedicated-server" target="_self" rel="undefined">Add a Dedicated server</a></li>
</ul>
<p>During that process, select your VPS in the dropdown to migrate all data. Once everything has been migrated, you can then delete your VPS:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Upgrading to DreamPress</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to upgrade an existing WordPress site to DreamPress.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If you only had the single WordPress site on your VPS, you can then cancel it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003876392-Delete-a-VPS" target="_self">Delete a VPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other sites on the VPS, you must continue paying for that plan since only the single site would have been migrated to DreamPress.</p>
