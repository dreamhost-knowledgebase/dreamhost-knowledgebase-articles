<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01H9RHNNK3ZE478WVAKGT3CVQ4">Can I use this plugin to migrate a WordPress multisite?</h3>
<p>Yes. After installing the plugin, make sure to 'Network Activate' it to ensure it can run from the Network Admin dashboard. However, please note the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The migration must move the whole network to DreamHost. It does not allow the migration of individual subsites, or the import of a subsite into a different network.</li>
<li>The recommended hosting plans for WordPress Multisite are VPS, Dedicated, or DreamCompute. Multisite installs on Shared and DreamPress plans are not recommended or supported.</li>
<li>DreamHost Support does not offer technical assistance with Multisite installs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01H9RHNNK3C4QDBGVPYK0EYV8C">Are there any restrictions or limitations?</h3>
<p>The plugin will work with the vast majority of WordPress sites, themes, plugins, and configurations. However, please note that you cannot migrate the following types of sites using this plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress sites set up at WordPress.com. However, you can import the content of your pages, posts, and embedded images.</li>
<li>Sites built using&nbsp;Wix, Weebly, SquareSpace, Joomla, or other site builders</li>
<li>WordPress sites developed in local environments (e.g., ServerPress)</li>
<li>Your site must already be a WordPress site in order to migrate an exact copy of your site using this or any other plugin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HA2FJM3PGF8SS1GCFPQA6CW4">Are there size limits on the migration?</h3>
<p>At this time, you can migrate a WordPress site of any size using this plugin. Please note the time to complete the migration increases for larger sites.</p>
