<h2><span id="getting-started">Getting started</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Be sure to do the following before you install the DreamHost Automated Migration plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test and install all available updates for WordPress, including all installed themes and plugins. Make sure your site has no errors or hacked code.</li>
<li>To avoid any downtime on your site, keep the domain's DNS pointed at your old host until the migration is complete and you’ve had a chance to look at the migrated site at DreamHost.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to install the DreamHost Automated Migration plugin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Step 1 — Finding your DreamHost account information</h3>
<p>The following explains what information you need and where to find it in the DreamHost web panel.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you haven't already, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">Add Hosting</a>&nbsp;to your domain in your DreamHost panel.</li>
<li>If you manually added hosting to your domain, install WordPress as a&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-How-to-install-WordPress-using-the-One-Click-Installer" target="_self">One-Click Install</a>.
<ul>
<li>It's okay to do this while your domain is hosted at your old host. Adding hosting at DreamHost does not affect your current hosting. Your existing site will remain live for now.</li>
<li>If you are concerned about affecting your existing live site, you can add a temporary subdomain name ending with <strong>.dream.press</strong>&nbsp;(for DreamPress sites), or <strong>.dreamhosters.com</strong> for all other hosting plans. Please note that creating a temporary test site will create extra work at the end of the process since you'll have to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214580498-How-do-I-change-the-WordPress-Site-URL-" target="_self">update your database to the correct URL</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure the user assigned to your domain is either an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access" target="_self">SFTP or Shell user</a>. An FTP user will cause the migration to fail.</li>
<li>Locate your Migration Key in the DreamHost panel:
<ul>
<li>DreamPress plans: Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=wordpress.dreampress#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed WordPress</a> page. Click the <strong>Manage</strong> button to the right of your domain, click the <span class="text-object">Migration</span> tab on the next page, and then click the blue <strong>Generate Migration Key</strong> button.</li>
<li>All other plans: Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Websites</a> page and follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click one of the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>From Grid view, hover over your domain's preview image, and click the <strong>Manage</strong> button.</li>
<li>From List view, click the <strong>Manage</strong> button to the right of your domain.</li>
</ul>
<li>When the <span class="panel-page">Manage Websites</span> page opens, click the <span class="text-object">Website</span> tab.</li>
<li>Find the <span class="text-section">Migrating this site to DreamHost?</span> section (in the WordPress box).</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Get Key</strong> button.</li>

</dl>
</li>
<li><strong>Migration Key</strong>: Enter your Migration token.</li>
<li>The four options are optional and should only be filled out if needed.
<ul>
<li><strong>Source Website Password Protected</strong>: Is your source website password protected currently to simply view the homepage? - Generally, this is not password protected</li>
<li><strong>Destination Website Password Protected</strong>: Is your destination website password protected currently to simply view the homepage? - Generally, this is not password protected</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Options</strong>:&nbsp;This generally does not need to be filled out.</li>
<li><strong>Add folders</strong>:&nbsp; This option allows you to select non-WordPress core-specific files, in the event you have a custom setup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bookmark the URL to check your migration's progress and close the browser tab or window while it is running.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most migrations take under an hour to complete, but if your site is larger than a couple GBs of data, it could take more than an hour. Once it completes, you will receive a notification email to the address you entered during the step above.</p>
</div>
<h2>Checking your migrated site and making it live on DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>If your domain is the same at DreamHost and the old host</h3>
<p>Add '.dream.website' to the end of your domain to view the migrated site on DreamHost. For example, if your domain is <strong>example.com</strong>, view your migrated site at <strong>example.com.dream.website</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the migrated site, change your domain's DNS to point to DreamHost.</p>
<p>For more information on how to change your nameservers at your current host, see the following article:</p>

</ul>
<h3>If you chose a different domain name at DreamHost from the old host</h3>
<p>You can use a different domain name to view your site at DreamHost while the current site remains live. Make sure any new domain name you chose is already using DreamHost DNS records.</p>
<h3>If you are using a temporary subdomain name ending in .dreamhosters.com or .dream.press</h3>
<p>You can use the temporary subdomain name to immediately view the migrated site.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DreamPress domains</strong>: when you are ready to make your site live at DreamHost using your real domain, follow <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115004353927-Changing-the-name-of-a-DreamPress-domain">these instructions</a> to rename your domain.</li>

<h2><span id="faqs">FAQs</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Can I use this plugin to migrate a WordPress multisite?</h3>
<p>Yes, the <span class="text-object">Migrate to DreamHost</span> plugin allows the migration of a WordPress network or Multisite install. After installing the plugin, make sure to 'Network Activate' it to ensure it can run from the Network Admin dashboard. However, please note the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The migration must move the whole network to DreamHost. It does not allow the migration of individual subsites, or the import of a subsite into a different network.</li>
<li>The recommended hosting plans for WordPress Multisite are a DreamHost VPS, Dedicated, or DreamCompute. Multisite installs on Shared and DreamPress plans are not recommended or supported.</li>
<li>DreamHost Support does not offer technical assistance with Multisite installs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Are there any restrictions or limitations?</h3>
<p>The plugin will work with the vast majority of WordPress sites, themes, plugins, and configurations. However, please note that you cannot migrate the following types of sites using this plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress sites set up at WordPress.com</li>
<li>Sites built using&nbsp;Wix, Weebly, SquareSpace, Joomla, or other site builders</li>
<li>WordPress sites developed in local environments (e.g., ServerPress)</li>
</ul>
<p>WordPress sites set up at WordPress.com cannot be migrated using this or any other plugin as an exact copy of the original site to any other host. You can, however, import the content of your pages, posts, and embedded images using the instructions found on this page.</p>
<p>Your site must already be a WordPress site in order to migrate an exact copy of your site using this or any other plugin. This means that the <span class="text-object">Migrate to DreamHost</span> plugin cannot be used to migrate other types of sites, such as those built using Wix, Weebly, SquareSpace, Joomla, or other site builders.</p>
<p>At this time, you can migrate a WordPress site of any size using this plugin. Please note the time to complete the migration increases for larger sites.</p>
