<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A common issue after adding an SSL certificate is that your browser still shows your site as insecure. This most often happens because there are links on your page that still point to <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> instead of <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>. For example, look at the following code to link an image.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;img src="<span class="code-highlight">http</span>://www.example.com/images/pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View"&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>Notice how the URL is directly linked with <span class="text-object">http</span> at the beginning. When visiting the site in Firefox, the following is displayed:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/01_SSL_troubleshooting.png" alt="01 SSL troubleshooting.png" width="419" height="380" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see the <span class="text-object">padlock</span> icon in the top left of the browser shows a <span class="text-object">warning</span> icon instead.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Cause_of_this_error">Cause of this error</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you click on the <span class="text-object">warning</span> icon the text explains that there are 'unencrypted elements' on the page you're viewing.</p>
<p>From the example above, this is happening because the image was linked using <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> and not <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>. Another way to confirm what on your site is linked insecurely is to use the following site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whynopadlock.com/">whynopadlock.com</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Browser HTTPS errors</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you attempt to connect to a site that has a missing, invalid, or self-signed SSL certificate using an <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> URL, your browser shows a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767487#self_signed_warnings">security warning</a> such as 'Your connection is not private' in Chrome or 'Potential Security Risk Ahead' in Firefox. For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/chrome-not-secure.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3>Checking the JavaScript console</h3>
<p>You could also check the JavaScript console in your browser. This may also display a warning as to why the site is not loading.</p>
<p>In FireFox and Chrome, you can open the console by pressing the following keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows</strong> — <span class="code">Ctrl + Shift + i</span></li>
<li><strong>Mac</strong> — <span class="code">Option&nbsp;+ Cmd + i</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Click the console tab.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/console-tab.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You may see the following warning in the console.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/blocked-loading-mixed-content.png" /></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Fixing the error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are a few steps you must make in order to fix this error.</p>
<h3>Step 1 — Add an SSL certificate</h3>
<p>All modern sites should use a valid SSL certificate. View the following article for instructions on how to add an SSL certificate to your site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">Adding an SSL certificate overview</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2 — <span id="Fixing_unencrypted_elements">Fixing unencrypted links</span></h3>
<p>There are two solutions:</p>
<h4><strong>Use absolute links</strong></h4>
<p>Absolute links are the full url location to your file. This includes the domain name. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;img src="<span class="code-highlight">https://www.example.com</span>/images/pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View"&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>Just make sure you're using <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> when linking this way.</p>
<h4><strong>Use relative links</strong></h4>
<p>Relative links do not include the domain name. These links point to a local file instead. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;img src="images/pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain View"&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>View the following link for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp">HTML File Paths</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3 — <span id="content-security-policy">Resolving the warning by adding code to your .htaccess file</span></h3>
<p>Instead of manually updating links in your code, you could add the following lines to your site's .htaccess file.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP" target="_self">Creating and editing a file via FTP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview" target="_self">.htaccess overview</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Header always set Content-Security-Policy "upgrade-insecure-requests;"</pre>
</div>
<p>These lines force the browser to automatically update any insecure links to secure links. Once added, the warning should immediately disappear. View the following link for further details.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/upgrade-insecure-requests" target="_self">CSP: upgrade-insecure-requests</a></li>
</ul>
