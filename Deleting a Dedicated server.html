<p>When deleting your Dedicated server, you have the option to permanently delete all users and data, or migrate everything to a different server. Make sure you follow the steps below carefully, otherwise you could potentially lose data on your server.</p>
<h2>If you want to migrate your data to a different server</h2>
<p>This is most often the case when deleting a Dedicated server. This can also be thought of as downgrading your Dedicated server to a different hosting plan.</p>

<p>If you wish to keep your website active and migrate it to a different hosting plan, you must already have a Shared or VPS hosting plan active. Only then will you have the opportunity to migrate the data to this new server when you are canceling.</p>
<p>If there is no other hosting service in place, the website will go down and your account will only be available for domain registrations.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure to have another hosting plan active if you wish to keep your site up and running.</strong></p>

<li>First, make sure you've already purchased a second hosting plan. This could be a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared or VPS</a> plan.</li>

<li>To the right of your server, click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</li>
<li>Choose the option to migrate your data to your other server. This ensures your data is copied to the new server where you'll continue to host your site.</li>

<h2>If you no longer wish to host your site</h2>
<p>If you no longer need your website, you can delete the Dedicated server on the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dedicated.dashboard&amp;" style="background-color: #ffffff;">(Panel &gt; 'Dedicated Servers' &gt; 'Dashboard')</a> page. Make sure you've backed up any necessary data first, as it will not be recoverable after you delete the server.</p>
