<p>DreamHost strives to keep customers in the loop of any issues that could possibly affect service. The primary method of announcing system changes and status information is the status page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dreamhoststatus.com/">DreamHost Status Blog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This should be checked regularly for most announcements.</p>
<p>However, DreamHost may still send announcements to customers in order to notify them of upgrades, service outages, and so on.</p>
<h2>Can I get announcements emailed to me?</h2>
<p>General announcements are displayed on the status blog. Any specific announcements to you show in your support history which are also emailed to the primary email listed on the account.</p>
<p>To make sure you receive any such announcements, click the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001898171-Updating-your-contact-information-and-privacy-settings">edit profile link</a> in the panel.</p>
<p>This takes you to your profile page where you can view and/or change your account details. Here you can set your preferences for email notifications from DreamHost.</p>
