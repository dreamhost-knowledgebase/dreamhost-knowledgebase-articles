<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost strives to keep customers in the loop of any issues that could possibly affect service. The primary method of announcing system changes and status information is the status page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dreamhoststatus.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamHost Status Blog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This should be checked regularly for most announcements.</p>
<p>However, DreamHost may still send announcements to customers in order to notify them of upgrades, service outages, and so on.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can I get announcements emailed to me?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>General announcements are displayed on the status blog. Any specific announcements to you show in your support history which are also emailed to the primary email listed on the account.</p>
