<p>As of June 2016, DreamHost upgraded VPS servers running Debian Etch, Lenny, or Squeeze to Ubuntu for any NON-Admin users. Additionally, any sites running PHP versions 5.4 or lower were upgraded to PHP 5.6.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_the_update_happening.3F">Why is the update happening?</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost is updating Debian 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 because:</p>

<li>Debian 6.0 (Squeeze) was EOL'd in February 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p>DreamHost is also updating PHP because:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3 and 5.4 have already been EOL'd.</li>
<li>PHP 5.5 will be EOL'd in July 2016.</li>
<li>PHP 5.6 is well-tested, stable, and has been in production since August 2014.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_does_this_affect_my_PHP_settings.3F">How does this affect my PHP settings?</span></h3>
<p>It's likely that older and outdated versions of PHP will no longer work after the upgrade (e.g., PHP 4, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4).</p>
<p>Please visit the following articles to view the latest versions at DreamHost, as well as info on how to upgrade your version:</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_if_I.27m_using_an_.htaccess_file_with_rules_for_PHP_5.2_.28or_older.29.3F">What if I'm using an .htaccess file with rules for PHP 5.2 (or older)?</span></h3>
<p>If you're using an .htaccess file to enable an older/outdated version of PHP, you must comment out those rules and convert the php.ini file into a phprc file.</p>
<p>The following are code examples you may see in the file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Options +ExecCGI 
AddHandler php5-cgi .php 
Action php-cgi /cgi-bin/php-wrapper.fcgi 
Action php5-cgi /cgi-bin/php-wrapper.fcgi
</pre>
</div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Will_my_Python_and_Ruby_libraries_also_be_affected.3F">Will my Python and Ruby libraries also be affected?</span></h3>
<p>Your custom Python installations and Ruby installations could result in errors due to outdated gems/eggs.</p>
<p>To fix, DreamHost recommends reinstalling the custom Python/Ruby installations (and/or gems/eggs).</p>
<p>Older installations of Python linked to static libraries will break. To fix, you must update your scripts so they no longer link to such libraries as these.</p>
<p>For example, a common linked static library is <code>libmysql.so.l7</code></p>
<p>Your install​ should instead update to <code>libmysql.so</code></p>
<p>For Ruby, updating/reinstalling offending gems seem to resolve the issue in most cases. For example, if the following error appears:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">`require': libmysqlclient_r.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such 
file or directory -
</pre>
</div>
<p>use the following to fix:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">gem uninstall mysql2</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">gem install mysql2</span>
</pre>
</div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="What_if_my_custom_settings_were_originally_set_up_by_an_admin_user.3F">What if my custom settings were originally set up by an admin user?</span></h3>
<p>DreamHost recently removed admin users from VPS plans. Even though your custom settings may still work, these installations will also be removed once you are upgraded to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>If you have any custom settings that were originally set up by an admin user, you will need to set up such changes via a non-sudo setup.</p>
<p>If your configuration/installation requires sudo, you may wish to consider upgrading to <a class=" " href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/computing/" rel="nofollow">DreamCompute</a> or a <a class=" " href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/dedicated/" rel="nofollow">dedicated server</a>.</p>
