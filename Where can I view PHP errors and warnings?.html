<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When PHP changes are made on your site (usually from&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895317-How-do-I-change-the-PHP-version-of-my-site-">upgrading the PHP version</a>), you may find that PHP throws errors and warnings. In the past, these would display on your website and you could turn them off using a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.</p>
<p>DreamHost now disables all PHP warnings by default. This means you should never see them on your website when making changes to PHP.</p>

<h2><span id="Display_warnings">How can I display the warnings on my site?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To display the warnings on your site, you just need to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214894037-How-do-I-create-a-phprc-file-via-FTP-">add the following line to your phprc file</a>:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">display_errors = on</pre>
</div>
<p>If any PHP errors are thrown, they will now display on your site.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended on a live website since visitors will see the errors. The better option is to specify which types of errors you'd like to log and enable PHP error logging as described below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="Controlling_what_type_of_errors_display">Controlling what type of errors display</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>PHP allows you to specify which type of errors you would like displayed, or to save to your PHP error log file. For example:</p>
<table class="wikitable"><colgroup> <col width="38%" /> <col width="62%" /> </colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="#F2F2F2">PHP directive</th>
<th bgcolor="#F2F2F2">Explanation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>error_reporting = E_ALL&nbsp;</td>
<td>Logs all errors and warnings</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>error_reporting = E_ERROR</td>
<td>Fatal errors that occur during PHP's initial startup.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>error_reporting = E_WARNING</td>
<td>Run-time warnings (non-fatal errors). Execution of the script is not halted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>error_reporting = E_NOTICE</td>
<td>Logs runtime notices (usually bugs in your website code)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>A full list of options can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php" target="_self">https://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can exclude certain types of errors by using the bitwise operator <span class="code">~</span>. For example, this will show all errors except NOTICE and DEPRECATED warnings.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">error_reporting = E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE &amp; ~E_DEPRECATED</pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="Error_reporting">Setting error reporting in your script</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>As mentioned above, the <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file controls which errors are displayed. As such, the following lines will not function in your PHP script to display errors:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ini_set('display_errors',1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);</pre>
</div>
<p>The only way to display errors is to edit your <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Error_logging">Configuring custom error logging</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can add code to your <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file on the server to log all PHP errors in a new file named <span class="text-object">php.log</span>.</p>
<h3>Decide where the php.log file should go</h3>
<p>You must first decide where you want your <span class="text-object">php.log</span> file to be created. This can be in any directory you like as long as your user is able to write to that directory. The most simple location would be in your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">user's home directory</a>. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/username/php.log</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>It's not possible to create your <span class="text-object">php.log</span> file in your <span class="text-object">/home/username/logs</span> directory. This directory is created by DreamHost and owned by dhapache, therefore it's not possible for your user to write to this directory.</p>
</div>
<h3>Editing the phprc file</h3>
<p>Add these lines to your <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">log_errors = 1 <br />error_log = /home/<span class="code-highlight">username</span>/php.log</pre>
</div>
<p>Replace <strong>username</strong> with your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access">SHELL user</a>.</p>
<h3>Kill off all running php processes</h3>
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">kill running php processes</a> to ensure your new settings take effect.</p>
<h3>Confirming your changes</h3>
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, you should check to confirm the values have updated. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-Viewing-your-site-s-PHP-version-and-settings" target="_self">phpinfo.php file</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">My phprc file isn't updating</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Testing the php.log file</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To test the <span class="text-object">php.log</span> file, create a PHP file that throws an error. For example, create a file named error.php with the following content and upload it to your site.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;?php 
$file=fopen("welcome.txt","r");
?&gt;&nbsp;</pre>
</div>
<p>Visit the <strong>example.com/error.php</strong> page in a browser. An error is thrown. If you then check your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">user's home directory</a>, you'll see the <span class="text-object">php.log</span> file has been created and that it logged this PHP error. Run the following to check it:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">cat ~/php.log</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At first, the new <span class="text-object">php.log</span> file will not exist. Only after a PHP error is thrown is the <span class="text-object">php.log</span> file automatically created. This file will then continue to log any future PHP errors.</p>
