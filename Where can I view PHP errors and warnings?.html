<p>When PHP changes are made on your site (usually fromÂ <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895317-How-do-I-change-the-PHP-version-of-my-site-">upgrading the PHP version</a>), you may find that PHP throws errors and warnings. In the past, these would display on your website and you could turn them off using a phprc file.</p>
<p>DreamHost now disables all PHP warnings by default. This means you should never see them on your website when making changes to PHP.</p>
<h2>Where can I view PHP errors and warnings?</h2>
<p>Since these warnings have been turned off globally, you won't see them on your site. But you can still see all PHP errors and warnings in your error.log file.</p>
