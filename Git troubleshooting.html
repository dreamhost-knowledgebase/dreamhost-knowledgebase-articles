<p>You may see this error when connecting to certain repositories from a DreamHost server. This is related to an Ubuntu 14 bug. DreamHost is working on a patch, but currently has no ETA on when this will be resolved. In the meantime, the best option is to use a different operating system (Windows / Mac / Linux) to work with that specific repository.Â </p>
