<h2 id="h_01HXW0XPNH240Z3FKAZXFM7Y2Z">What is a data center?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A data center is a facility that houses different types of servers such as website servers, database servers, mail servers, and cloud servers. If you have purchased hosting services from DreamHost, your website data is stored and protected within a data center.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXW0XPNHVDTZTNN9BHTGRMG8">Where are DreamHost's data centers located?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost currently has data centers in Ashburn Virginia and Hillsboro Oregon.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HXW0XPNHQT29KWTQKN6WCF6C">Where is my data center?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can view which data center your services are located in within your panel. Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.dc&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Centers</a>&nbsp;page. This page lists all of your services and the corresponding data center they are located in.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HXW0XPNH074TD73PF5HX32J0">Does it matter where my data center is located?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The only time this is really an issue is if your website uses a database. This is because your web server and database server should always be in the same data center.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the web server and database server could be placed in different data centers. This could lead to slowness on your site since it takes a little longer for the information to be retrieved from the other data center.</p>
<p>If you notice this, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">contact support</a> so they may migrate your servers to the same location.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HXW0XPNHNCXX27EZ28NMAA3E">Can I change my data center?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes.&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">Contact support</a>&nbsp;if you'd prefer your information be located in a different data center.</p>
