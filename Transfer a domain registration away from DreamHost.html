<p>The following describes how to transfer your domain registration to another registrar.</p>
<p>The details listed here are only for transferring your domain’s <strong>registration</strong> to another registrar. Transferring your site's <strong>hosting</strong> is a completely different process. You can read more about that process in the following article:</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Due to ICANN's Transfer Policy, any change made to the registrant's name, organization, or email address will put the domain in a 60-day transfer lock. This change will also trigger notification emails to the old and new registrants, notifying them of the change. Before you initiate a transfer, be sure to opt out of the 60-day transfer lock using the panel.</p>
<p>For more information about the new policy and how to opt out of the 60-day transfer lock, please visit the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/235175787-ICANN-Transfer-Policy">ICANN Transfer Policy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that even if you change your privacy settings, the 60-day lock is triggered. So make sure the checkbox is selected to opt out.</p>
</div>
<p>Before you submit the transfer request to your new registrar, you need to complete a few steps. This section provides an overview of these steps, and the full steps are shown below.</p>
<p>The following changes should be made to your domain name:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unlock the domain registration for transfer&nbsp;in the panel at <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Registrations</a>.</li>
<li>Obtain the auth code, also known as the EPP code, from the panel on the Transfer Registrations page. You need this code to complete the transfer-in request at your new registrar.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HZPMRBBC40SGAG0BMTTM1MJT">When should you start the transfer?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Due to ICANN restrictions, you cannot transfer a domain registration within 60 days of the original purchase or if it has been transferred to DreamHost in the last 60 days.</p>
</div>
<p>The transfer can potentially take several days to complete, so it's best to start the process as soon as possible before the registration expires. DreamHost recommends initiating the transfer at least a full week before the domain expires.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HNEB95J3GC46ZW5VZQ4J1B42">Step 1 — Unlocking your domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The lock status is displayed on your panel’s Manage Registrations page and on a WHOIS lookup.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <span class="panel-page">Manage Registrations</span> page shows the <span class="text-object">Transfer Lock</span> column.</li>
<li>The status states either 'Locked' or 'Unlocked'.</li>
<li>Clicking the toggle button changes the status.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your domain may be locked to prevent the transfer of it. A locked domain appears as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-registration-locked.png" alt="Registration locked" width="131" height="102" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If it is locked, you must unlock it before proceeding with the request for the transfer. Click the toggle to switch to unlock it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2x/panel-registration-unlocked.png" alt="Registration unlocked" width="131" height="117" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you do a WHOIS lookup for the domain registration, you can also see the lock status there. Check the <span class="text-section">Domain Status</span> section of the WHOIS lookup for the domain. If it’s locked, the following status appears:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Domain Status: clientTransferProhibited https://www.icann.org/epp#clientTransferProhibited</pre>
</div>
<p>If the domain is unlocked, the following status appears:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Domain Status: ok</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="steps-section--step"><img class="steps-number-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/number-2.svg" alt="" width="50px" />
<h2 id="h_01HNEB95J3JZKTEBJ117G81K7M">Step 2 — Acquiring your domain's EPP (auth) code</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The second step in preparing your domain registration for transfer is retrieving its auth code (or EPP code). This code allows you to make the transfer request with the receiving registrar.</p>
<p>To view/send the auth code (EPP code):</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.transfer&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transfer Registrations</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the link titled <span class="text-link">Or transfer away from DreamHost</span>.
<dl>
<dd><em>A page opens that displays your domains.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Reveal Auth Code</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on your Top-Level Domain (TLD), you can either reveal your auth code (EPP code) in the panel or have it sent to the Registrant contact address (as specified by your WHOIS).</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>When sending the EPP/Auth code through the <span class="panel-page">Transfer Registrations</span> page, please check the junk/spam folder for the Admin contact email address you set for the registration.</p>
</div>

<div class="steps-section--step"><img class="steps-number-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/number-3.svg" alt="" width="50px" />
<h2 id="h_01HNEB95J3AES86DZYMVKS13XR">Step 3 — Requesting the transfer</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Domain registration transfers have to be initiated through the gaining registrar's interface. This is done after you’ve completed the preparation for the transfer.</p>
<p>Each registrar has a different method for initiating domain registration transfers. If you're unsure what to do, please contact your gaining registrar and ask them how to initiate a domain transfer to them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, here is a list of help guides for popular domain registrars:</p>

<dt><a href="https://www.networksolutions.com/domain-transfer/" rel="nofollow">Network Solutions</a></dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Once you’ve completed the request for the transfer, you should expect to be notified to approve the incoming transfer with the new registrar (however, they may process that request).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When DreamHost receives the transfer request, its system will send you an email to the address in your account profile. That email links you back to the panel at Transfer Registrations,</span>&nbsp;which allows you to click the <strong>Approve</strong> button to approve the release of the domain for transfer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The pending transfer shows in the <span class="text-section">Transfer a domain registration <em>away from</em> DreamHost section</span> of the <span class="panel-page">Transfer Registrations</span> page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once both the approval of the incoming transfer with the new registrar is completed and the approval for the release of the domain is confirmed with DreamHost, the transfer should be completed within <strong>a few minutes but may take up to 7 days</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>DreamHost does not have a status on outgoing domain registration transfers; it only provides a status for incoming transfers. If you need to know the status of the outgoing transfer, you must contact the registrar to which you’re transferring it.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HNEB95J3DFKGR9GYFG7GPM6H">How do I transfer a *.uk domain away from DreamHost?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ul>
<li>.uk domains do not have an EPP code. To transfer a *.uk domain that you own at DreamHost to another registrar, please ask your new registrar for their IPS tag. IPS tags are case-sensitive, and once an IPS tag is changed, it cannot be reversed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once you obtain the new registrar’s IPS tag, log in to your DreamHost panel, unlock your domain, and use the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact Support</a> page to contact a support representative.</li>
<li>When submitting your request, clarify that the IPS tag on your domain needs to be changed for you.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please contact your new registrar </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">after the IPS tag change has been confirmed, as their system may require additional steps to complete the process</span>.</li>
