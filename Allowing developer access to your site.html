<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It may be necessary at some point to hire a developer to work on your website.&nbsp;There are a few different ways a developer may require access to your site in order to work on it. The access you grant a developer depends on exactly what tools they need to complete the job you hired them for.</p>

<p>The type of login credentials you share with your developer depends on what task they need to accomplish.</p>
<p>Make sure you're only giving them the basic level of access they require.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This article lists the following different types of access you could grant a developer and the different login credentials associated with each option.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#panel" target="_self">Access to your panel</a></li>
<li><a href="#server" target="_self" rel="undefined">Access to the web server</a></li>
<li><a href="#database" target="_self" rel="undefined">Access to the database server</a></li>
<li><a href="#app" target="_self">Access to your website application</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="panel">Panel access</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If a developer only needs access to your DreamHost panel, you can just grant them Account Privileges.</p>

</ul>
<p>Account Privileges allow you to grant access to specific pages in your panel to a single user. Make sure you remove the Account Privileges when they no longer require access.</p>

<h2><span id="service">Server access to the website</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>For security purposes, DreamHost implements a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215562847-One-user-per-domain-policy" target="_self">One user per domain policy</a>. This ensures that only a single username has access to a domain on the server.</p>
<p>This means that you must give the developer the username and password credentials of your website user in order to log into the server and work on your site.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>Make sure you trust your developer before sharing your website credentials!!!</strong></p>
</div>
<h4><strong>Sharing credentials</strong></h4>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p>Before proceeding, make sure the code to your website does not contain any absolute file paths that include your username. They would appear like this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/<span class="code-highlight">username</span>/example.com/</pre>
</div>
<p>If so, you will need to update those references when the website switches to the new username. If not, your site will not function properly.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>First, create a new user on the server for the developer.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjust your website to use this new username. Make sure you select the option to copy files to the new user.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020605511-Changing-the-user-assigned-to-a-domain" target="_self" rel="undefined">Changing the user assigned to a domain</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the website is functioning under the new username, you can share the new credentials with your website developer.</li>
<li>When the website developer is finished with their work, change the username back to your original username. This ensures only you have access again to your site.</li>
<li>Finally, delete the user you created for the developer.

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2><span id="database">Database access</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A developer may also need access to the database your website uses. You should always create a new database user for the developer.</p>
<ul class="article-list">
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060957212-Adding-and-deleting-a-database-user">Adding and deleting a database user</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to delete the user when the developer no longer requires access.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="app">WordPress (or another CMS)</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Content Management System (CMS) software allows you to download a software program and build a site on top of it. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress</li>
<li>Drupal</li>
<li>Magento</li>
<li>Concrete CMS</li>
</ul>
<p>If your developer only needs to work on this type of site, they may only require the login credentials for the software program itself and <strong>NOT</strong> the user's credentials used to log into the server. View the following links for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694298#Website_users" target="_self" rel="undefined">Website users</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694298#Application_users" target="_self">Application users</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, you'd just create a new user in your CMS for the developer. For example, this article explains how to add a user to WordPress:</p>

</ul>
<p>Always make sure to delete the new user when the developer no longer requires access.</p>
