<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are several ways to redirect a URL. This is useful for redirecting requests from their main domain to another directory under that domain, such as directing requests for <strong>example.com</strong> to <strong>example.com/blog</strong>. This can be done using a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747748-How-can-I-redirect-and-rewrite-my-URLs-with-an-htaccess-file-">.htaccess file</a>. However, it's also possible to redirect using PHP.</p>
<p>This article gives a quick example of creating a redirect using PHP.</p>

<li>Create a file named <span class="text-object">index.php</span>. You can do this using an FTP client such as Filezilla or via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.&nbsp;View the following articles for instructions on how to create it (depending on if you're using an FTP client or SSH):

</ul>

<li>Make sure the file is in the domain's directory. This directory is the one specified when adding the domain to your panel.

<li>In this <span class="text-object">index.php</span> file, add the following line of code:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;?php header("Location: <span class="code-highlight">https://www.example.com/blog</span>");&nbsp;?&gt;</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to change the sample URL to the URL you want the site to forward.</p>
<p>You'll then have a simple and quick redirection that you can use to redirect an HTTP request to any URL seamlessly.</p>
