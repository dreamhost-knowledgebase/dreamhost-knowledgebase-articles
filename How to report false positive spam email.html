<p>There may be situations when email you send is returned back to you and marked as spam.</p>
<p>This is because DreamHost scans all outbound email for potential spam—and since it is not possible to disable this feature, you can instead mark the returned email as a "false positive" in order for it to successfully send from the DreamHost mail server.</p>
<p>The following instructions describe how to find information in the bounced email in order to mark it as a false-positive spam message.</p>
