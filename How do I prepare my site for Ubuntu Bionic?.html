<p>The following provides information to help you prepare your site for the Ubuntu upgrade to version 18.04.1 LTS (aka Bionic).</p>
<h2><span id="prep">What to expect</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost will contact you via email in advance of the upgrade.</p>
<p>The time frame of an upgrade can vary from server to server, however the timing ensures that there are several highly trained engineers on hand should any major issues arise. The upgrade itself should take no longer than an hour to complete.</p>
<p>Any services that rely on the availability of your MySQL server (WordPress or any other database-driven websites, applications, and so on) will not be reachable until the upgrade is complete. This will NOT affect cloud or email services.</p>
<h2><span id="mysql">MySQL server changes</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost MySQL servers will be upgraded to MySQL version to 5.7 as part of the Ubuntu upgrade. MySQL 5.7 has <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/keywords.html">a list of "reserved" words</a> you cannot use as a database name. If you are affected by this, you have already been contacted by support and should <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360021851311-Renaming-your-database-in-the-DreamHost-panel">change your database name</a> immediately, as instructed.</p>
<h2>Web server changes</h2>
<h3><span id="telnet">Telnet</span></h3>
<p>Because Telnet is a deprecated protocol, it is removed from the latest version of Ubuntu Bionic in order to help keep your server secure. If you require telnet, DreamHost recommends running it on your local computer instead.</p>
<h3><span id="boto_s3cmd">Boto-rsync</span></h3>
<p>Because boto-rsync is outdated software and is no longer maintained, it is also removed from the latest version of Ubuntu Bionic. DreamHost recommends using <a href="https://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> instead. You can find out more about how to use s3cmd at DreamHost in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215916627-S3cmd">S3cmd</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="ruby">Ruby version change (from 1.9.3.4 to 2.5.1)</span></h3>
<p>The Ruby version on the server is changing to 2.5.1. If you would like more control over this, DreamHost strongly recommends using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217185247-Ruby-Version-Manager-RVM-">RVM</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/115001070131-Using-Bundler-to-install-Ruby-gems">Bundler</a>, you only need to run:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">bundle exec gem pristine</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>Then, reload passenger so that the changes take effect by touching a <span class="code">restart.txt</span> file from your apps 'tmp' directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">touch  tmp/restart.txt</span>
</pre>
</div>
<h3><span id="perl">Perl version change (from 5.18.4 to 5.26)</span></h3>
<p>Ubuntu Bionic includes a new version of Perl, 5.26.</p>
<p>For more information on updating your version of Perl, visit the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://metacpan.org/changes/release/XSAWYERX/perl-5.26.0">Change documentation between 5.24 and 5.26</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="python">Python version change (from 2.7.5 to 2.7.15)</span></h3>
<p>Ubuntu Bionic includes a new version of Python, 2.7.15. If you have not installed a custom version of Python in your virtualenv (and are, instead, using the server version), you may need to reinstall your virtualenv and all modules.</p>
