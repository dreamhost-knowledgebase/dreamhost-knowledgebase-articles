<h2><span id="Disk_usage">Disk usage</span></h2>
<p>To show the total disk usage for your VPS or dedicated server, use <code>df</code>. This will show you total, used, and available disk space. Adding the <code>-h</code> flag displays the numbers in a more readable format (KB, MB, GB, and so on).</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">df -h</span>
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1        24G  4.4G   19G  20% /
/dev/sda5       2.3G  1.1G  1.2G  49% /tmp
/dev/sda6        51G  2.0G   48G   4% /var

<p>Note that the output above was truncated. The actual output on DreamHost's servers can be quite a bit longer.</p>
<p>Your home directory and all your files are in <code>/home</code> (not listed above).</p>
<p>In the example below, the home directory is listed, and you can see from this that 26% percent of a 30GB partition is being used.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">

<h3><span id="Check_if_your_files_are_correctly_uploaded_.28check_for_file_integrity.29">Check if your files are correctly uploaded (check for file integrity)</span></h3>
<p>If you need to upload some large files to the server, you might want to check that they are correctly uploaded with no errors. To do that, just create an MD5 file and upload it to the server, in the same folder as the files you want to check.</p>
<p>An MD5 file is a plain text file that contains checksums of your files so their integrity can be verified afterwards; to create it you can use any MD5 tool for your operating system, or the command line utility in a UNIX like system with <code>openssl md5</code>.</p>
<p>Once you upload the MD5 file, go to the directory that contains the files you want to verify (and where you the uploaded the MD5 file) and enter the following command:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">md5sum -c yourfile.md5</span>
list: OK
of: OK
uploaded: OK
files: OK
being: OK
verified: OK
</pre>
</div>
<p>If all of the files report OK, the upload was completely successful. If any files report FAILED, it was not.</p>
