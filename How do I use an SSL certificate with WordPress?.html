<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Adding an SSL certificate to your WordPress site is an excellent first step toward securing your data. However, there are a few other steps you must take to fully ensure all links within your site point to the secure version of your domain name (This means the <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> version).</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Please note that these instructions do not apply to DreamPress sites. If your WordPress site is on DreamPress, please follow these instructions instead:</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Step 1 — Add an SSL certificate to the domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure your site is properly set up for <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>. You must first add&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">SSL certificate</a>&nbsp;to your site.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview" target="_self">Adding an SSL certificate overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your requirements for the site, you may also require a Unique IP address. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> article for more information.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Make sure your SSL certificate is active before continuing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2><span id="update-database-urls">Step 2 — Update database URLs</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>This step is only necessary if you added an SSL certificate to a site that was already built. If so, there are old <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> URLs that need to be updated to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>.</p>
<p>If this is a brand new site without any data, you can skip this step. This is because all new pages/posts you create will use the new <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> URL automatically.</p>
</div>
<p>Your WordPress database has several hard-coded URLs that point to the <span class="text-object">http</span> version of your domain. You have two options to update your database URLs. View the following article for further instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214580498-Change-the-WordPress-Site-URL" target="_self">Change the WordPress Site URL</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Step 3 — Verify the Home and Site URL are updated</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Log into WordPress using the new secure <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> URL.
<ul>
<li><strong>https://example.com/wp-login.php</strong></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-05-02_wordpress_ssl_01.png" alt="\" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Navigate to Settings -&gt; General page.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/WordPress_https.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>On the General page you should see your Home and Site URL now points to <span class="text-object">https</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Clear your plugin's cache</h3>
<p>At this point, you should also delete your cache if using WP Super Cache.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214588698#delete-cache" target="_self">Deleting the cache</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you check your site now, all URLs within your WordPress site will use the new domain name.</p>
</div>
<h2>Step 4 — Update your wp-config.php file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Log into your webserver via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>.</li>
<li>Find the file named <span class="text-object">wp-config.php</span> in your WordPress site directory, and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">then open it in a text editor</a>.</li>
<li>​Add the following two lines above the line that​ says <strong>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</strong>:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('FORCE_SSL', true);
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN',true);
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Step 5 — Force the URL to redirect to HTTPS</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you have&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview">added an SSL certificate</a>&nbsp;to your domain,&nbsp;DreamHost automatically redirects the URL visitors use to view your site from <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>. The <span class="text-object">S</span> ensures that your connection is encrypted. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https</strong>://example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>There's nothing on your end you must do in order to force your site to use the secure URL. However, in some special cases, it may be necessary for you to&nbsp;create your own custom configuration file to force the redirect from <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span>.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>Adding custom code is only necessary if your website requires specific code to force the redirect</strong>. If so, you will need to first disable the automatic redirect in your panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027022831-Disabling-the-automatic-redirect-to-HTTPS" target="_self">Disabling the automatic redirect to HTTPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once disabled, you can then proceed with <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003505112-Force-your-site-to-redirect-to-HTTPS-SSL-" target="_self">adding your custom redirect file</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Most WordPress sites do NOT require you to add code to the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file to redirect it. However, if your specific WordPress site requires custom code for some reason, you&nbsp;could force your site to redirect from <span class="text-object">HTTP</span> to <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> using the following article code.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747758#Forcing_HTTPS_with_WordPress">Update rules in your site's .htaccess file</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Step 6 — Prevent mixed-content warnings using an .htaccess file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's a good idea to add a line of code to your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file to avoid any possible mixed-content warnings. View the following article for further details.</p>

<p>This section is only necessary if you have also <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216477717-Enable-Cloudflare-on-a-domain">added Cloudflare to your domain</a>. If so, view the following article for information on how to configure it properly.</p>
