<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Adding an SSL certificate to your WordPress site is an excellent first step towards securing your data. However, there are a few other steps you must take to fully ensure all links within your site point to the secure version of your domain name (This means the 'HTTPS' version).</p>

<p>Please note that these instructions do not apply to DreamPress sites. If your WordPress site is on DreamPress, please follow these instructions instead:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Add an SSL certificate to the domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure your site is properly set up for HTTPS. You need to have an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">SSL certificate</a> applied to your site and possibly a Unique IP address depending on your requirements for the site. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> article for more information.</p>

<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Make sure your SSL certificate is active before continuing.</p>

<h2>Update database URLs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your WordPress database has several hard-coded URLs that point to the 'http' version of your domain. To update everything very quickly to 'https', use a plugin. This will change all internal URLs to use the new secure URL. View the following article for instructions on how to do this with a plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003300591-Changing-your-WordPress-database-URLs-to-https-using-a-plugin">Changing your WordPress database URLs to https using a plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At this point all URLs in your database now point to 'https'. You'll be logged out after running the plugin above. Log back into your site again at the 'https' URL instead. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://example.com</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Verify the Home and Site URL are updated</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>After running the plugin above, log into WordPress using the new secure HTTPS URL.
<ul>
<li><strong>https://example.com/wp-login.php</strong></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-05-02_wordpress_ssl_01.png" alt="\" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Navigate to Settings -&gt; General page.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/WordPress_https.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>On the General page you should see your Home and Site URL now points to 'https'.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Update your wp-config.php file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Log into your webserver via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>.</li>
<li>Find the file named 'wp-config.php' in your WordPress site directory, and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">then open it in a text editor</a>.</li>
<li>​Add the following two lines above the line that​ says <strong>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</strong>:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('FORCE_SSL', true);
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN',true);
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
