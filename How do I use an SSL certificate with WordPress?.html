<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Adding an SSL certificate to your WordPress site is an excellent first step towards securing your data. However, there are a few other steps you must take to fully ensure all links within your site point to the secure version of your domain name (This means the 'HTTPS' version).</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Please note that these instructions do not apply to DreamPress sites. If your WordPress site is on DreamPress, please follow these instructions instead:</p>

<h2>Step 1 — Add an SSL certificate to the domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure your site is properly set up for HTTPS. You must first add&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041537-SSL-certificates-overview">SSL certificate</a>&nbsp;to your site.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089118-Adding-an-SSL-certificate-overview" target="_self">Adding an SSL certificate overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on your requirements for the site, you may also require a Unique IP address. See the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a> article for more information.</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Make sure your SSL certificate is active before continuing.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2><span id="update-database-urls">Step 2 — Update database URLs</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your WordPress database has several hard-coded URLs that point to the 'http' version of your domain. You have two options to update your database URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a Plugin</li>
<li>Use the command line</li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for further instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003304711-Changing-all-URLs-in-your-WordPress-database" target="_self">Changing all URLs in your WordPress database</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Step 3 — Verify the Home and Site URL are updated</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Log into WordPress using the new secure HTTPS URL.
<ul>
<li><strong>https://example.com/wp-login.php</strong></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-05-02_wordpress_ssl_01.png" alt="\" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Navigate to Settings -&gt; General page.
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/WordPress_https.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>On the General page you should see your Home and Site URL now points to 'https'.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Clear your plugin's cache</h3>
<p>At this point, you should also delete your cache if using WP Super Cache.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214588698#delete-cache" target="_self">Deleting the cache</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you check your site now, all URLs within your WordPress site will use the new domain name.</p>
</div>
<h2>Step 4 — Update your wp-config.php file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Log into your webserver via <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a>.</li>
<li>Find the file named 'wp-config.php' in your WordPress site directory, and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">then open it in a text editor</a>.</li>
<li>​Add the following two lines above the line that​ says <strong>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</strong>:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">define('FORCE_SSL', true);
define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN',true);
</pre>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Step 5 — Force the URL to redirect to HTTPS</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can force your site to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747758#Forcing_HTTPS_with_WordPress">Update rules in your site's .htaccess file</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-https/">Use a WordPress HTTPS plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's also a good idea to add a few more lines of code to your .htaccess file to avoid any possible mixed-content warnings.</p>
