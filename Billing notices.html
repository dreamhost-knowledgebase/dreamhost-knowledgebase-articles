<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you have a due balance on your account, DreamHost will send out email notices to you in order for you to pay a due balance so that your account will avoid suspension.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HKNNW1AXD0S96C46WZR7CG6S">How can I ensure that the billing notice I received was from DreamHost?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>All billing notices come from a dreamhost.com email address. You can also verify which emails were sent to your account contact by checking your support history in your panel. Visit the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.his&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support History</a>&nbsp;page for this information.</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost sends billing reminder notices to the primary email contact on the account once your monthly invoice has been closed.</li>
<li>Until the balance due is paid, you’ll receive another reminder email weekly to the primary contact on the account.</li>
<li>There is a 60-day grace period for all due balances (from the date the invoice was issued) before the account is suspended for non-payment.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HKNNW1AXM575Y7K87F7162RH">Where are billing notices sent?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Billing reminder notices are sent to the primary email address that the account owner has listed in their DreamHost account. DreamHost does not send physical reminder notices to a mailing address, and are only sent via email.</p>
<p>To check where billing reminder emails are sent or add/change these email addresses, log in to your <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamHost panel</a> and click the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Profile &amp; Privacy</a> link under your Username on the upper right of the screen:</p>
