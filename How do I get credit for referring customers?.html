<p>The "DreamHost Rewards Program" provides a very lucrative commission plan for affiliate partners of DreamHost.</p>
<p>When you refer a customer DreamHost and they purchase a hosting plan, you are able to receive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-time rewards</strong> – One-time rewards are applied to a customer’s account the first time a referred customer makes a payment for any full hosting plan. DreamHost does not pay for any referrals other than the direct new customer referred from you. View the <a href="#What_you_can_earn">chart below</a> for a list of current payouts.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Referring_new_customers">Referring new customers</span></h2>
<p>It's very simple to refer new customers and receive reward credits. All you need is your unique rewards link.</p>
<h3><span id="Locating_your_unique_rewards_link">Locating your unique rewards link</span></h3>
<p>You can retrieve your referral link in your panel, on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.affiliates&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Billing &amp; Account' &gt; 'Affiliates'</a>) page. This link is formatted as https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?########, where ######## is your account number.</p>
<h3><span id="Using_your_unique_rewards_link">Using your unique rewards link</span></h3>
<p>You can use your direct referral link to refer your friends to a specific URL at dreamhost.com. You can list your referral link on your blog, website, or provide the link to your referred customer directly. By using the link you provided to sign up, your referred customer automatically lists you as their referrer on their new account. Your referred customer won’t need to enter your information anywhere in order for you to receive a referral credit.</p>
<p>For example, you could provide them with this link (customized to your specific referral link URL):</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>https://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?########/domains/</strong></dd>
</dl>
<p>And this will direct them right to "http://www.dreamhost.com/domains/" which is the domain registration landing page. Your referral information will be stored in their browser.</p>
<p>The ‘<strong>xxxxx</strong>’ at the end of the link should include your Account Number. New customers that sign up through that link will sign up with your account listed as the referrer.</p>
<p>DreamHost also offers several <a href="https://securendn.a.ssl.fastly.net/newpanel/files/affiliate-banners.zip">banners and logos</a> you can use to attract new customers as well.</p>
