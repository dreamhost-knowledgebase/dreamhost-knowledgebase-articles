<p>Do not use these instructions unless explicitly instructed to by the DreamHost Professional Services Team. The following information is only to be used in a particular phase of a WP migration being done for you by that team; otherwise, the steps will be out of context and can lead to errors if implemented.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now that the migration is complete, it's time for you to approve it. First, a word of caution:</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img height="60" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60"/></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Please note that the Professional Services Team needs to hear back from you within 7 business days, or the migration will be considered implicitly approved by you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Below are instructions on how to view the migrated site. Once the Professional Services Team is informed that you approve of the migration, specific instructions will be sent notifying you of how to make your site (at DreamHost) the public one for your domain, and how to handle email and HTTPS/SSL issues, if any.</p>
</div><h2>Should I change my DNS to DreamHost if I like the migrated site?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Please do NOT change your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> to DreamHost at this time. There may be additional steps you'll need to take even if you see no issues with the migrated site, and DreamHost's goal is to help you through these to minimize any downtime. You should first reply back to the email from the Professional Services team to notify them of your approval of the migrated site. If there is additional information or tasks to complete to make your site live on DreamHost, they will share it in the next email.</p>
<p>If you have already pointed your site's DNS to DreamHost before approving the migration, the Professional Services Team presumes the migration is approved by you and has successfully completed. This means that the Professional Services Team will no longer support you with the migration. If you encounter any problems with your DNS change and would like the continued assistance of the Professional Services Team, please change DNS back to your original settings before replying.</p>
<p>If you have already made the DNS change, it is highly recommended that you review the final knowledge base article pertaining to your migration service to ensure minimal disruption to services on your domain name:</p>

</ul>
<h3>DreamPress caching</h3>
<p>Part of the remarkable speed that DreamPress provides is due to the way it caches content using the built-in server cache. Even though DreamPress uses advanced caching, you may experience unexpected behavior in how your site displays updated content.</p>
<p>If you happen to make changes and see a lag between the time you save a change and the time it appears, you may want to click the 'Purge Cache' link within the Cache drop-down menu, located in the WP-Admin toolbar at the top:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="2018-10_wp-admin_proxy_cache_03.fw.png" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-10_wp-admin_proxy_cache_03.fw.png"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>For more information about using the DreamPress Cache, see the following article:</p>

</div><h2>Viewing your site migrated before making it public</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can view your migrated site (before it is public) by editing the 'hosts' file on your home computer. This allows you to view the site as it appears on DreamHost's servers without changing your DNS to point to DreamHost.Â </p>
<p>This has zero effect on your live (public) site at the current hosting company. When you update your computer's 'hosts' file, only you are able to see how your site appears at DreamHost. Everyone else continues to see your current live site at your current hosting company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">View the following article for instructions on how to edit your computer's 'hosts' file. Once edited, only the computer you're working on will be able to see your migrated (non-public) site. Any other computer will continue to see your public site.</span></p>
