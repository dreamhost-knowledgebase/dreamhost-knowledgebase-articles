<p>Each new DreamHost account must go through an approval process before any hosting or registration services can be used. This checks the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">signup</a> details to ensure that the information is legitimate and to protect against fraudulent accounts. This article details what causes an account to have a “Pending” status and how to resolve this issue.</p>
<h2><span id="Why_does_my_new_account_show_as_.E2.80.9CPending.E2.80.9D_in_the_DreamHost_panel.3F">Why does my new account show as “Pending” in the DreamHost panel?</span></h2>
<p>If your account is pending, you’ll see the following notice in your panel:</p>

<dd><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/2018-07_panel_pending.png"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>When an account’s status shows as “Pending” for more than a few hours after signup, this means that the automated approval system was not able to approve the account on its own. This may indicate an issue with either your payment details, or the signup process may have been incomplete. There are several reasons why your account may still be pending. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the information you provided did not match the credit card details you entered, so the system checks to ensure that this is not fraud.</li>
<li>The signup process did not finish or you may not have completed the signup form, therefore only your WebID was created.</li>
<li>It can take a few hours for the automated approval system to process your request if there are many other pending new accounts to process at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other reasons why an account may be pending, but these are the most common reasons.</p>
