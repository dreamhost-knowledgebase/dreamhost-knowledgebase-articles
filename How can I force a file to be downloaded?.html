<h2>Forcing a file to be downloaded</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>By default, if a text file (.txt) is requested, the contents of the file is shown in the browser and is not downloaded. This is because the default MIME type for .txt files specifies to show the files and not download them. However, you can change this by adding the following line to your .htaccess file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">AddType application/octet-stream txt
</pre>
</div>
<p>You can change the extension to anything you like such as mp3 or mov. Here is another example which does the same thing â€“ any files ending in mov, mp3, jpg, or pdf are automatically downloaded:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">&lt;FilesMatch "\.(<span class="code-highlight">mov|mp3|jpg|pdf</span>)$"&gt;
ForceType application/octet-stream
Header set Content-Disposition attachment
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</pre>
