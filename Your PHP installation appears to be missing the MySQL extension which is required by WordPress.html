<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When visiting your WordPress site, it's possible you may see this error:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.</pre>
</div>
<p>This is most often caused by a PHP version customization in your .htaccess or phprc files.</p>
</div>
<h2>Check which version of PHP you're site is using</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>First, check which version of PHP your site is using with a phpinfo.php file.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-Viewing-your-site-s-PHP-version-and-settings">Viewing your site's PHP version and settings</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure it matches the version of PHP your panel shows for your domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214898997-What-version-of-PHP-is-my-site-using-">What version of PHP is my site using?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a mismatch, there is a potential customization somewhere causing the versions to be different.</p>
</div>
<h2>Check for customizations</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Check your .htaccess file for PHP customizations</h3>
<p>First, check the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess</a> file in your website's main directory. It will most likely be located here:</p>
<ul>
<li>/home/username/example.com/.htaccess</li>
</ul>
<p>Open that file in an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP">FTP</a> client or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">SSH</a>. Check to make sure there are no lines referencing a different version of PHP.</p>
<h3>Check your phprc file for PHP customizations</h3>
<p>After confirming which version of PHP you're site is using above, check your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">phprc file</a>. It will be located here:</p>
<ul>
<li>/home/username/.php/php#.#/phprc</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to adjust the php#.# to the version of PHP your site is using. Check your phprc file using an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000098272-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-FTP">FTP</a> client or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">SSH</a> to ensure there are no customizations that could potentially cause an issue.</p>

<h2>For Dedicated servers</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're on a Dedicated server, your MySQL version may be 5.6. If so, and you're seeing this error, add the following line to your site's phprc file.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">extension = mysql.so</pre>
