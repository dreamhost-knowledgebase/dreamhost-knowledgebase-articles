<h2>Allowing users to reset their own email password</h2>
<p>If you're an account manager with several email users, you'll find that the individual email users will need the ability to reset their own passwords. 'Account Privileges' do <strong>NOT</strong> need to be granted for this. Every email use can log into <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217133137-The-Mailboxes-interface"><strong>mailboxes.example.com</strong></a> with their email and current password. Once logged in, they can reset it.</p>
<p>If the user does not remember the current password, they must contact the account manager.</p>
<p>If panel access is required for any email address, the only option is to give access to the entire domain to that user. However, this gives the user access to ALL email addresses on the entire domain including the ability to manage the domain, so be very careful when assigning such a privilege.</p>
