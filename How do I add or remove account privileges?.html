<h2>Allowing users to reset their own email password</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're an account manager with several email users, you'll find that the individual email users will need the ability to reset their own passwords. 'Account Privileges' do <strong>NOT</strong> need to be granted for this. Every email user can log into <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217133137-The-Mailboxes-interface" target="_self">mailboxes.dreamhost.com</a> with their email and current password. Once logged in, they can reset it.</p>
<p>If the user does not remember&nbsp;the current password, they must contact the account manager.</p>
<p>If panel access is required for any email address, the only option is to give access to the entire domain to that user. However, this gives the user access to ALL email addresses on the entire domain including the ability to manage the domain, so be very careful when assigning such a privilege.</p>
</div>
<h2>Re-sending the confirmation email</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's not possible to re-send the original confirmation email after you've added a new user. However, there are two options available for the new user to log into their account.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new user can visit <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/login/forgot.cgi">https://panel.dreamhost.com/login/forgot.cgi</a> to reset their password and log in.</li>
<li>You can revoke all privileges as explained above. Then, after re-adding the user again, they will receive a new confirmation email.</li>
</ul>
