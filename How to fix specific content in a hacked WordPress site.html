<p>If you do not want to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214823608-How-do-I-replace-my-hacked-WordPress-site-">completely replace your site files</a>, you can still manually remove and replace specific content. However, this is not recommended as it’s much easier to miss any infected files.</p>
<h2><span id=".htaccess_file">.htaccess file</span></h2>
<p>Many hackers insert code into the standard WordPress .htaccess file. The best thing to do is to completely remove the old, hacked .htaccess and generate a new one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your FTP client is set to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-do-I-show-hidden-files-on-my-FTP-client-">view hidden files</a>.</li>
<li>Delete the old hacked .htaccess file (if it exists).</li>
<li>In your WordPress Dashboard, go to 'Setting &gt; Permalinks' and re-save its permalink settings.
<ul>
<li>The direct URL for the page is <a href="http://example.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php">http://example.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php</a> (replace example.com with your WordPress site).</li>
<li>This re-creates the base .htaccess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have the WP Super Cache plugin installed, view the following article:
