<h2><span id=".htaccess_file">.htaccess file</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Many hackers insert code into the standard WordPress <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file. The best thing to do is to completely remove the old, hacked <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> and generate a new one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure your FTP client is set to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-to-view-hidden-files-in-an-FTP-client">view hidden files</a>.</li>
<li>Delete the old hacked .htaccess file (if it exists).</li>
<li>In your WordPress Dashboard, go to <span class="text-section">Settings &gt; Permalinks</span> and re-save its permalink settings.
<ul>
<li>The direct URL for the page is <strong>https://example.com/wp-admin/options-permalink.php</strong> (replace <strong>example.com</strong> with your WordPress site).</li>
<li>This re-creates the base .htaccess.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have the&nbsp;WP Super Cache plugin installed, view the following article:

<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you have the old WordPress install at <strong>example.com</strong> and another site at <strong>example.com/othersite/</strong>, clicking the <strong>Delete all Files</strong> button will remove everything including the non-WordPress site at <strong>example.com/othersite</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure your FTP client is set up to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-to-view-hidden-files-in-an-FTP-client">view hidden files</a>.</li>
<li>Delete all files beginning with <span class="text-object">wp-</span>.</li>
<li>Delete all directories beginning with <span class="text-object">wp-</span>.</li>
<li>Delete the following files (if present):</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><span class="text-object">.htaccess</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">index.php</span></li>

<li><span class="text-object">readme.html</span></li>
<li><span class="text-object">license.txt</span></li>

<p>At this point, there should be no remaining items in the directory but files you have uploaded. If there are files still there that you do not recognize, examine them carefully as they may be files placed there by a hacker. If you are certain that you do not want these files, you can delete them.</p>
