<p>Yes. What you’re looking for is a feature called, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview">Account Privileges</a>. What this allows you to do is set up a secondary web panel login and grant permissions on specific domains, databases, users, etc. The secondary login only has access to what you grant them. Keep in mind, just because they can manage a domain or if you grant them access to billing, only the primary account user receives notifications on expiring domain registrations or hosting renewals.</p>
