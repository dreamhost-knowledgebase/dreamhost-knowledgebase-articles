<p>DreamHost was originally founded in 1997 as the New Dream Network while its founders were still undergraduates at <a class="external text" href="http://www.hmc.edu/" rel="nofollow">Harvey Mudd College</a> in Claremont, California. Here's a picture of Josh, Sage, Michael and Dallas on graduation day.</p>

<p>DreamHost offers four types of webservers which you can use to host your website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared servers – <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared hosting</a></li>

</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="WordPress_dedicated_hosting_.28DreamPress.29">WordPress dedicated hosting (DreamPress)</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost also offers an upgraded and custom hosting package for WordPress sites called <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a>. This is premium WordPress hosting with the following features:</p>

</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Email_hosting">Email hosting</span></h2>
<p>Email hosting is included for free with any of the hosting plan. This includes free <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216540008-atmail-webmail-overview">Webmail</a> service as well. However, it’s not possible to host email without a hosting plan, which means that if you wish to host email at DreamHost for your domain, you must also purchase a hosting plan as email-only accounts are not available.</p>
<p>DreamHost also offers two types of list services (these services do not require a hosting plan):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215683487-What-is-an-Announcement-mailing-list-">Announcement lists</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215029188-How-do-I-create-a-Discussion-List-">Discussion lists</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Domain_registrations">Domain registrations</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost offers the ability to purchase a domain registration from within the panel. Purchasing a domain registration does not require you to also have a hosting plan with DreamHost – once the domain is registered, you can host it anywhere you like. However, it’s easier to keep everything in the same place.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you purchase a shared hosting plan, you get a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-">free registration</a> for the following domains during the first year of hosting:</p>
<ul>
<li>.club</li>
<li>.com</li>
<li>.info</li>
<li>.net</li>
<li>.online</li>
<li>.org</li>
<li>.site</li>
<li>.store</li>
<li>.xyz</li>
</ul>

<p>Most registrars force you to pay an extra fee to keep your personal information hidden, but DreamHost includes this service to you for free with your domain registration.</p>
