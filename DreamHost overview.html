<h2>Domain registrations</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost offers the ability to purchase a domain registration from within the panel. Purchasing a domain registration does not require you to also have a hosting plan with DreamHost – once the domain is registered, you can host it anywhere you like. However, it’s easier to keep everything in the same place.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you purchase a Shared Hosting plan, you get a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-">free registration</a> for the first year of hosting. View the following article for a list of domains this applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937#free">Free domain registrations</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>In order to qualify for one free domain registration credit for the first full year, you must sign up for a 1-year or 3-year annual plan on a <strong>Shared Starter</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Shared Unlimited</strong>,&nbsp;or any annual&nbsp;<strong>DreamPress</strong>&nbsp;plan&nbsp;(monthly Shared or monthly DreamPress plans do not apply). This free credit is NOT available under any other hosting plan. Please visit the following pages to view more details:</p>
