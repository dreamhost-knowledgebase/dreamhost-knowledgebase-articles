<p>DreamHost was originally founded in 1997 as the New Dream Network while its founders were still undergraduates at <a href="http://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in Claremont, California. Here's a picture of Josh, Sage, Michael and Dallas on graduation day.</p>

<h2><span id="Email_hosting">Email hosting</span></h2>
<p>Email hosting is included for free with any of the hosting plan. This includes free <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216540008-atmail-webmail-overview">Webmail</a> service as well. However, it’s not possible to host email without a hosting plan, which means that if you wish to host email at DreamHost for your domain, you must also purchase a hosting plan as email-only accounts are not available.</p>
<p>DreamHost also offers two types of list services (these services do not require a hosting plan):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215683487-What-is-an-Announcement-mailing-list-">Announcement lists</a></li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215029188-How-do-I-create-a-Discussion-List-">Discussion lists</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Domain registrations</h2>
<p>DreamHost offers the ability to purchase a domain registration from within the panel. Purchasing a domain registration does not require you to also have a hosting plan with DreamHost – once the domain is registered, you can host it anywhere you like. However, it’s easier to keep everything in the same place.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you purchase a shared hosting plan, you get a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215249528-How-do-I-use-a-free-domain-registration-">free registration</a> for the following domains during the first year of hosting:</p>
<ul>
<li>.com</li>
<li>.info</li>
<li>.life</li>
<li>.net</li>
<li>.online</li>
<li>.org</li>
<li>.store</li>
<li>.tech</li>
<li>.xyz</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to qualify for one free domain registration credit, you must sign up for an <strong>annual shared</strong> hosting plan (monthly shared hosting does not apply). This free credit is NOT available under any other hosting plan. Please visit the following pages to view more details:</p>
