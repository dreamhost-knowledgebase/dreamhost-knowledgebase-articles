<p>This article describes how to sign up for Google Workspace within your DreamHost panel.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, make sure you have an active domain registration in your DreamHost account, as it will be used as the primary domain associated with your Google Workspace services. During Google Workspace signup, you are asked to select from your list of available domains.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If your domain does not appear in the dropdown menu, it is not eligible for Google Workspace. This typically occurs when the domain already has an active Workspace account with Google. See the following article for more information</p>
