<p>This article describes how to sign up for Google Workspace within your DreamHost panel.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HG72217Z0Y8SX1XNQ5GQZPHY">Before you sign up</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure you have an active domain registration in your DreamHost account, as it will be used as the primary domain associated with your Google Workspace services. During Google Workspace signup, you are asked to select this domain in your account.</p>
<p>If your domain does not appear in the dropdown menu, it is not eligible for Google Workspace. This typically occurs when the domain already has an active Workspace account with Google. See the following article for more information</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you signed up for Google Workspace when you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-sign-up-for-a-DreamHost-account">originally created your account</a>, you must still activate it in the panel. You will receive a reminder email a few days after signing up with instructions on how to activate Google Workspace.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HFFQ44PTMWD0RSGM8MM8NVA8">Confirmation emails</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you have signed up, you are sent the following two confirmation emails:</p>
<ul>
<li>One from DreamHost</li>
<li>One from Google</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you use your new Google Workspace email address and password you just created when logging into the Google Workspace panel.&nbsp;If you forgot the username of the new address you created, please <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview" target="_self">contact support</a>&nbsp;to retrieve or reset it.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HFFQ44PTZ6D8XSYXFPMQVF7G">The DreamHost email</h3>
<p>The DreamHost email confirms that you've added Google Workspace to your DreamHost domain. It also contains a link to log into your Google console at <a href="https://admin.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://admin.google.com</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HFFQ44PTJZ51ZF1Y9C2P6RRT">The Google email</h3>
<p>DreamHost attempts to auto-verify your domain with Google every 15 minutes. Because of this, the email may take up to 15 minutes to arrive.</p>
<p>The Google email links you to the admin console. Once logged in, you'll need to accept the User Agreement and Terms of Service in order to proceed.</p>
