<p>Canceling Google Workspace is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure you wish to proceed before canceling your Google Workspace Subscription with DreamHost.</p>
</div>
<p>You may cancel your Google Workspace plan at any time after your 30-day free trial has expired.</p>
<p>Canceling your Google Workspace subscription with DreamHost ends your relationship with your Google Workspace account as purchased and managed through DreamHost. Google will contact you directly to establish billing with them if you'd like to continue your Google Workspace services independently of DreamHost.</p>

<h2>Do NOT cancel your Google Workspace account to fix a problem</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Do not cancel your Google Workspace account to resolve any configuration issues you're having with it. If you cancel, you will be unable to create a new plan, and DreamHost will no longer have access to help you resolve the issue you were experiencing.</p>
<p>Contact DreamHost support to resolve any problems you're having with your account. This is the only way to ensure your account is configured correctly.</p>
</div>
<h2>Reasons to manage your Google Workspace account directly with Google</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are a few reasons why you may need to manage your Google Workspace account directly with Google instead of managing it through DreamHost:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Upgrading to Google Workspace Enterprise</strong>: DreamHost does not currently support the Google Workspace Enterprise plan. If you require more than what the Google Workspace Business Plus plan provides (5 TB per user), you will need to <a class="reference internal" href="#cancel-g-workspace">cancel your subscription through the DreamHost panel</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2633430">set up billing with Google</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/10069619">upgrade to the Enterprise plan with Google</a> directly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enabling Paid Google Workspace Add-ons</strong>: Google offers additional services for Workspace that require you to be billed directly through Google (Google Voice, Cloud Identity, and <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/add-ons/" target="_self">so on</a>). You will need to <a class="reference internal" href="#cancel-g-workspace" target="_self" rel="undefined">cancel your subscription through the DreamHost panel</a>, set up billing with Google, and then sign up for any additional paid add-on through your Google administrator console.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What happens to your account when you cancel</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following occurs when you cancel your Google Workspace account in the DreamHost panel.</p>
<ul>
<li>Billing through DreamHost stops.</li>
<li>Your Google Workspace account is transferred to Google.</li>
<li>Google contacts you directly to establish billing with them.</li>
<li>Your MX (mail) DNS records will stay pointed to Google in case you wish to set up services directly with them. If you would rather switch to DreamHost-hosted email:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.mx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Custom MX</a> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button to the right of your domain.</li>
<li>At the top, click the <strong>Make me regular now!</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
