<h2>What happens to your current hosting plan when upgrading?</h2>
<p>If your WordPress site is on a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared, VPS, or Dedicated hosting plan</a>, upgrading to DreamPress will only <strong>add</strong> a new DreamPress plan. It will <strong>not</strong> remove your old hosting plan. This means you'll still be paying for the old plan, as well as the new DreamPress plan.</p>
<p>If you have only one website, you can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203372007-Cancel-Account">cancel your existing hosting plan</a> since you will only be using the DreamPress plan going forward.</p>
<p>If you have multiple websites on the old hosting plan, you must keep it active.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Purchasing a DreamPress plan creates a new hosting plan that's billed separately from any other hosting plan you may have. Any previous balance on another hosting plan does not transfer to the new DreamPress plan.</p>
