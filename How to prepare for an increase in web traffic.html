<h2 id="h_01HP8B0GK707G7QS043NFM3ST6">Keep your software up to date</h2>

<h2 id="h_01HP8B0GK8NSTBCF3Z98Q0RCKC">Enable caching</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your site provides dynamic content or is database driven (i.e., WordPress, Joomla, ZenCart, MediaWiki, phpBB, WebCalendar, and so on), you may want to enable some form of "caching" add-on. See that particular application's support page for further details and suggestions. If you’re running a WordPress site, review the following article:</p>

<h2 id="h_01HP8B0GK83S045JT8FGS8028N">Prevent spam</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your site allows visitors to leave comments, please make sure you're using some type of plugin to prevent spam comments. For example, if you're using WordPress, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300907-WordPress-anti-spam-plugins">Akismet</a> is a good choice.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you can convert dynamic pages to static pages, that would help tremendously (but it may be difficult to do). Some caching tools, such as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214588698-Installing-WP-Super-Cache">wp-super-cache</a>, include the ability to do this using the plugin.</p>

<div id="Throttle_or_disable_your_site" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 id="h_01HP8B0GK8BRYQRP1M3NQ31QR3">Throttle or disable your site</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If for whatever reason your increased traffic causes problems for the server, it may be necessary for support to "throttle" your site (restricting the number of simultaneous visitors or maximum throughput, or the like) or possibly even disable it. This is done in fairness to the other customers on your server.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Remember that you're on a Shared Hosting plan and one customer cannot jeopardize the operation of the server for all of the other customers. DreamHost support offers optimization suggestions to help your site remain up and running, however it’s ultimately your responsibility to make sure your site does not negatively affect other users.</p>
</div>
<p>If it is necessary to throttle your site for some reason, support will contact the owner of the account with the details. If there is a problem with your site that you can resolve, make sure to notify support with details of what you did to fix the problem. Then, support may remove the throttle in place.</p>

<div id="Upgrade_options" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2 id="h_01HP8B0GK88GJA3W5GVBP70TR7">Upgrade options</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If it’s not possible to optimize your site any further, it may be necessary to upgrade your hosting plan to a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>. This is a separate hosting plan on a VPS which gives you your own 'virtual machine'. The VPS plan allows you to allocate the amount of RAM necessary to run your site. Even in the case of a spike in traffic, your site will not affect other users on the server. Visit the following articles for further information:</p>

<p>If you're using WordPress, you can also consider upgrading to a DreamPress plan, which provides additional server robustness, caching, and memory to your WordPress site. Visit the following articles to learn more about DreamPress:</p>
