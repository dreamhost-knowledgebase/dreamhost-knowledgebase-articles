<h2><span id="Free_Reputation_Monitoring">Free Reputation Monitoring</span></h2>
<p>Reputation Monitoring is a comprehensive daily check on the status of your website by checking the following services:</p>

<p>For each domain that StopTheHacker protects, you are able to see the current real-time security status from the DreamHost web panel.</p>
<h2><span id="Comprehensive_Malware_Scanning_Programs">Comprehensive Malware Scanning Programs</span></h2>

<h2><span id="Server_Configuration">Server Configuration</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>StopTheHacker must be supplied with a Shell login to be as effective as the regular DreamHost scan. FTP will not cut it. There is currently no warning about this, but they're working on it.</li>
<li>Credential verification happens on submission. If the password is reset (either shell or FTP) after giving them the credentials they are not currently able to warn users that the service is no longer as effective as it could be. If you reset your passwords, don't forget to manually update them on the STH website.</li>
<li>StopTheHacker needs all directories to have 750 permissions to run their scripts on them.</li>
