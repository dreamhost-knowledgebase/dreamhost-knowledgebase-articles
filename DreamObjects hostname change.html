<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, DreamHost is migrating all DreamObjects data to a new and improved data center on the East coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Old DreamObjects accounts were configured on a cluster located on the West coast of the United States. Beginning June 21, 2018, DreamHost began allowing users to migrate their existing DreamObjects accounts to a new and improved cluster on the East coast of the United States. This new cluster will help with the long term stability of your data.</p>
<h2>What's changing?</h2>
<p>Since your DreamObjects data will be hosted in a new data center, the following changes are required from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Migrate your data to the new EAST cluster before Oct 1st 2018</li>
<li>Update your client or any URLs you use to connect to your DreamObjects bucket to <strong>objects-us-east-1.dream.io</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Migrating your bucket data</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to migrate your bucket data from the WEST coast data center to the EAST coast.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Updating your hostnames</h3>
<p>After you have migrated your data, you must then update all references to the old hostname. This means that if you use a client to connect to your DreamObjects Bucket, you'll need to update its settings. Additionally, if you have any scripts that connect to your DreamObjects Bucket, they will also need to be updated.</p>
<p>You'll need to adjust your hostnames as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Old hostname:  <strong>objects-us-west-1.dream.io</strong></li>
<li>New hostname: <strong>objects-us-east-1.dream.io</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your bucket names and keypairs remain the same and your data will not be modified in any way. You just need to update the hostname that connects to your Bucket (after migrating your data).</p>
