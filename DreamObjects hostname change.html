<h2>Overview</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, DreamHost has migrated all DreamObjects data to a new and improved data center on the East coast of the United States.</p>
<p>Old DreamObjects accounts were configured on a cluster located on the West coast of the United States. Beginning June 21, 2018, DreamHost began allowing users to migrate their existing DreamObjects accounts to a new and improved cluster on the East coast of the United States. This new cluster will help with the long term stability of your data.</p>
</div><h2>What do I need to change?</h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Since your DreamObjects data is hosted in a new data center, you must update your client or any URLs you use to connect to your DreamObjects bucket to <strong>objects-us-east-1.dream.io</strong></p>
<h3>Updating your hostname in DreamObjects clients</h3>
<p>If you use a client to connect to your DreamObjects Bucket, you'll need to update its settings. Additionally, if you have any scripts that connect to your DreamObjects Bucket, they will also need to be updated.</p>
<p>You'll need to adjust your hostnames as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Former hostname:  <strong>objects-us-west-1.dream.io</strong></li>
<li>New hostname: <strong>objects-us-east-1.dream.io</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your bucket names and keypairs remain the same and your data will not be modified in any way. You just need to update the hostname that connects to your Bucket.</p>
