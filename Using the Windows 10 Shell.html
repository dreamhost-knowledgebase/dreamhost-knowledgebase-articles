<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As of the April 2018, Windows 10 now offers a native Shell client for you to use. In the past it was necessary to use a 3rd party client such as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215464538-How-do-I-configure-PuTTY-">PuTTY</a>. You can now use the Shell built directly into Windows 10 to access your DreamHost web server without the need to download any other software.</p>
<p>This is also enabled by default, so you do not have to enable it within Windows.</p>
<h2>Using the SSH client within the Command Prompt</h2>
<p>To use the SSH client, open your Command Prompt. From there you can run SSH commands.</p>
