<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Windows 10 offers a native Shell client for you to use. In the past it was necessary to use a 3rd party client such as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215464538-Configure-PuTTY">PuTTY</a>. You can now use the Shell built directly into Windows 10 to access your DreamHost web server without the need to download any other software.</p>
<p>This is also enabled by default, so you do not have to enable it within Windows.</p>
