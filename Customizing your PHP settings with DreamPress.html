<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php">.user.ini</a> file is a simple text file that allows you to adjust your PHP settings. For example, the version of PHP on the server comes with a few default settings, such as a <span class="code">memory_limit</span> of 256MB, and you can change this using a <span class="text-object">.user.ini</span> file.</p>
