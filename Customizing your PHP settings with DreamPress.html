<p>A <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php">.user.ini</a> file is a simple text file that allows you to adjust your PHP settings. For example, the version of PHP on the server comes with a few default settings such as a <span class="code">memory_limit</span> of 90MB and you can change this using a .user.ini file.</p>

<h2>Creating a .user.ini file</h2>
<p>To customize your PHP settings, create a file named .user.ini in your website's directory. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/home/username/example.com</pre>
</div>
<p>You can create a .user.ini file by logging into your server via FTP or SSH. The following sections describe how to do this for both methods.</p>

<h2>Updating your changes</h2>
