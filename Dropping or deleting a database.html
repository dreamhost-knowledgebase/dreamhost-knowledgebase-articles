<p>Deleted Databases are moved to the recycle bin. You can access this by clicking the <strong>'MySQL Recycle</strong> <strong>Bin</strong>' button on the top left of the page. This allows for easy restoration of databases that are mistakenly deleted.</p>
<p>Databases are stored here for 30 days. After 30 days, they are permanently deleted. </p>
<p>If you wish to permanently delete a database, you can log into MySQL using the command and issue a "drop database" statement to expedite the process.</p>
