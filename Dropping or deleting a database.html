<p>You can delete a database created on DreamHost through on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.mysql" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MySQL Databases</a> page.</p>

<p>Deleted Databases are moved to the recycle bin. You can access this by clicking the <strong>'MySQL Recycle</strong> <strong>Bin</strong>' button on the top left of the page. This allows for easy restoration of databases that are mistakenly deleted.</p>
<p>Databases are stored here for 30 days. After 30 days, they are permanently deleted. </p>
<p>If you wish to permanently delete a database, you can log into MySQL using the command and issue a "drop database" statement to expedite the process.</p>
<h2>What happens to the database user?</h2>
<p>If the user for the database you deleted is NOT assigned to any other database, it will also be deleted along with the database.</p>
