<h2>The recycle bin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Deleted Databases are moved to the recycle bin. You can access this by clicking the <strong>MySQL Recycle</strong> <strong>Bin</strong>&nbsp;button on the top left of the page.&nbsp;This allows for easy restoration of databases that are mistakenly deleted.</p>
<p>Databases are stored here for 30 days. After 30 days, they are permanently deleted.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2>What happens to the database user?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If the user for the database you deleted is NOT assigned to any other database, it will also be deleted along with the database.</p>
