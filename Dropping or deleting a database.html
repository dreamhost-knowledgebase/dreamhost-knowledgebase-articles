<h2>Deleting a database</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can delete a database created on DreamHost through on the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.mysql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MySQL Databases</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>To the right of the database, click the red <strong>Delete DB</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>

<h2>The recycle bin</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Deleted Databases are moved to the recycle bin. You can access this by clicking the <strong>MySQL Recycle</strong> <strong>Bin</strong>&nbsp;button on the top left of the page.&nbsp;This allows for easy restoration of databases that are mistakenly deleted.</p>
<p>Databases are stored here for 30 days. After 30 days, they are permanently deleted.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2>What happens to the database user?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If the user for the database you deleted is NOT assigned to any other database, it will also be deleted along with the database.</p>
