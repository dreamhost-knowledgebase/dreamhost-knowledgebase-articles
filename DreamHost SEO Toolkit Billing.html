<p>This article describes the various billing options for the DreamHost SEO Toolkit and how to change to a different billing option if needed.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HA0HNVG2H09FF8FJJHM37WXA">Billing options</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost SEO Toolkit is billed monthly or yearly per website, with an introductory rate for the first year of use. Current prices are available on the following page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=marketing.seotoolkit#" target="_self">SEO Toolkit pricing options in the panel</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After you add a plan, the first month or first year's fee (depending on which plan you selected) is added to your invoice immediately.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HA0HNVG28AVM51B9EJQ9JWES">Introductory rate</h3>
<p>The introductory rate is only available once per website. If the SEO Toolkit plan is canceled, and then added to the same website in the future, the introductory pricing will not be available.</p>
