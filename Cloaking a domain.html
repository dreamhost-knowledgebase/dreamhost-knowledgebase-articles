<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you cloak a domain, the domain name continues to appear in your browser's address bar. However, the contents you are viewing are from a completely different website. View this article from Wikipedia for further information:</p>

<h2>Using an SSL certificate with a Cloaked domain</h2>
<p>You can only add an SSL certificate to a domain that is FULLY HOSTED. For this reason, you cannot add an SSL certificate to the Cloaked domain.</p>
<p>Additionally, if your site is cloaking a domain with an SSL certificate, it will only work if you visit the non-secure version of the cloaked URL. If you visit the secure (HTTPS) version of the cloaked URL, a browser error is thrown.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's not possible to display an SSL certificate using a cloaked URL.</p>

<li><strong>Site to display</strong>: The site URL you enter here is the site the visitor sees when typing in your URL. For example, if you enteredÂ <strong>dreamhost.com</strong>, any visitor to your site at 'example.com' would see the contents of 'dreamhost.com'.

<p>It may take several hours for the new DNS configuration to resolve online due to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS propagation</a>.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's possible that after you create the cloak and it has propagated online, the following error appears:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Domain Cloaking Error
We're sorry, we had a problem with our web panel when you set up cloaking for your domain example.com!
Please go to the DreamHost Web Panel's Domains &gt; Manage Domains area and click the [Edit] link next to example.com to re-configure cloaking.
Error: no domain example.com -- if you recently set this up, please wait up to one hour.</pre>
</div>
<p>If you are still seeing the error after a few hours, contact DreamHost on the support <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Support</a> page.</p>
</div>
<h2>Turning off a Cloak</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To turn off a Cloak, you must change the hosting configuration to any other option such as 'Fully Hosted' or 'DNS Only'. A full list can be found on the following page:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215909407-Domains-panel-overview">Domains panel overview</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>How long until the cloak is working?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Cloaking your site is the same as any other DNS change. This means the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> first before you can see the changes online. In general, this shouldn't take any longer than 6 hours. You can keep track of when the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">new DNS records</a> update in different locations at this site.</p>
