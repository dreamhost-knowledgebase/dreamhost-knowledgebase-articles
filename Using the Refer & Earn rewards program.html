<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">DreamHost is currently in the process of sunsetting the older Refer &amp; Earn rewards affiliate program in favor of a new program called <a href="https://partners.dreamhost.com/">TUNE</a>. It's recommended that you create a new account at <span class="text-product">TUNE</span> as soon as possible since this will be the the official affiliate plan used in the future. View the following article for further information on the new affiliate program:
