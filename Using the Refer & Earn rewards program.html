<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Earned rewards are available for redemption after the 97-day holding period, provided that the affiliate has chosen to cash out their rewards. For affiliates who have completed adding a payment method and have successfully submitted tax documents, approved conversions are paid out via Direct Bank Transfer between the 15th and the last business day of the month. Conversions must be outside of the 97-day holding period and approved for payout on, or before, the 14th of a given month in order to be paid out by the last business day of that month. Any conversion that is approved for payout after the 14th of the month will be paid out during the following month's payout period.</p>
<p>In the event of possible credit card fraud or high cancellation rates during the 97-day holding period, DreamHost reserves the right to hold the rewards for up to two (2) additional months for verification. At DreamHost's sole discretion, it reserves the right to cancel rewards in the event of any the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost is unable to collect funds from the referred customer.</li>
<li>The order is fraudulent.</li>
<li>The customer cancels within the first 97 days.</li>
<li>The reward was earned improperly for any other reason.</li>
