<p>To display a website on the internet, you need to do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>
</li>
<li>Add hosting to the domain</li>

<p>This article assumes you've already purchased the domain registration.</p>
<h2>What is a 'Fully Hosted' domain?</h2>
<p>Below are instructions on how to add a domain to your account as 'Fully Hosted'. When a domain is 'Fully Hosted', it's set up on a web server and assigned <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS records</a>. Once DNS have been assigned, you can then visit the website on the Internet. This requires a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>.</li>
<li>Purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">hosting plan</a>.</li>
<li>Follow the directions below to add the domain to the hosting plan.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Do you want the www in your URL?:</strong> You have three options.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Leave it alone: The www and non-www version of your site both function.</dd>
<dd>Add WWW: This forces www to be added to your domain so when it's visited, it always appears as www.example.com</dd>
<dd>Remove WWW: This forces www to be removed so your domain always appears as example.com</dd>

<h2>Pointing DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<p>The site is now hosted on DreamHost's servers, but unless your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> is pointed to DreamHost, it will not resolve online. View the following sections depending on where you purchased your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>.</p>
<h3>If you purchased a registration with DreamHost</h3>
<p>If you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/224220668-How-to-purchase-a-domain-registration">purchased the registration at DreamHost</a>, the DNS is already configured correctly (unless you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215414867-How-do-I-add-custom-DNS-records-">customized</a> it).</p>
<h3>If you purchased the registration at another company</h3>
<p>You would need to point your DNS to DreamHost. View the following article for details:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Adding a One-Click Install to your site</h2>

<p>If you get the following error message:</p>
