<p>To display a website on the internet, you need to do two things:</p>
<ul>

<h2>What is a 'Fully Hosted' domain?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Below are instructions on how to add a domain to your account as 'Fully Hosted'. When a domain is 'Fully Hosted', it's set up on a web server and&nbsp;assigned <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS records</a>. Once DNS have been assigned, you can then visit the website on the Internet. This requires a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>.</li>
<li>Purchase a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">hosting plan</a>.</li>
<li>Follow the directions below to add the domain to the hosting plan.</li>

<h2>Pointing DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The site is now hosted on DreamHost's servers, but unless your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> is pointed to DreamHost, it will not resolve online. View the following sections depending on where you purchased your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview">domain registration</a>.</p>
<h3>If you purchased a registration with DreamHost</h3>
<p>If you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/224220668-How-to-purchase-a-domain-registration">purchased the registration at DreamHost</a>, the DNS is already configured correctly (unless you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215414867-How-do-I-add-custom-DNS-records-">customized</a> it).</p>
<h3>If you purchased the registration at another company</h3>
<p>You would need to point your DNS to DreamHost. View the following article for details:</p>

<h2>Adding a One-Click Install to your site</h2>

<h2>Why do I see the 'my site is almost here!' message on my page?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A new Fully Hosted domain includes a file named <span class="code">quickstart.html</span> in its root directory. This file contains a placeholder page that prompts you to upload your site, as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2019-10_website-almost-here.fw.png" alt="2019-10_website-almost-here.fw.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>DreamHost servers are configured to load this file by default unless you delete it or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747718-How-can-I-control-my-directory-indexes-with-an-htaccess-file-">add your own index file</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Error messages when adding a domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In some cases, an error message appears when you try to add hosting for a domain on your account. The most common error messages are described below.</p>
<h3>You must add the parent domain</h3>
<p>If you see:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">You can't add that domain: you must add the parent domain example.com to your account before adding a subdomain to it.</pre>
</div>
<p>it means that the second-level domain is not yet in the system. A subdomain can only be created if its second-level domain is created first (example.com)—even if you don't plan on hosting the second-level domain here at DreamHost.</p>
<h3>You don't have permission to add that domain</h3>
<p>If you see:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">You can't add that domain: you don't have permission to add.</pre>
</div>
<p>it means that the domain you are trying to add to your account is already hosted on another DreamHost account. If you are moving the domain from an existing account that you have access to, remember to remove the domain from the old account first before you add it to a new account. If you do not know what account the domain is currently hosted on, please <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a>.</p>
<h3>The domain name already exists in the system</h3>
<p>The <span class="code">domain name already exists in the system</span> error can occur in similar situations to the <span class="code">you don't have permission to add</span> error. If you see this error message, please confirm that the domain is not hosted on another DreamHost account and then <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a>.</p>
