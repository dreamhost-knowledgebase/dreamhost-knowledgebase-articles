<p>There is no SSH access to a Shared or Private MySQL server. All troubleshooting must be done in the DreamHost panel or within your software.</p>
<p>If you require SSH access, you must upgrade to a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview" target="_self" rel="undefined">Dedicated Server</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214840947-What-is-DreamCompute-">DreamCompute</a> where the database is hosted on the same machine.</p>

<h3>Updating 'Allowable hosts'</h3>
<p>Also, make sure that your current IP address is added to the database's allowable hosts. You can manage this setting on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.mysql" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL Databases</a> page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-09_panel_database_credentials_02.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>To the right of your database, click the username. On the next page you can see the 'Allowable hosts' field.</p>

<p>In the image above, you would replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with your computer's IP address. You can find it on a site such as <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/">whatismyipaddress.com</a>. The panel also displays your current IP address in this section.</p>

<h2>Reboot the server</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Due to the nature of shared MySQL hosting, it's not possible to reboot your MySQL server. The only way this would be possible is if you were on a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview" target="_self" rel="undefined">Dedicated Hosting plan</a>. On a Dedicated Server, the MySQL server is hosted on the same machine allowing you full root access.</p>

<h2><span id="Error_messages">Error messages</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>"<em>Loading local data is disabled; this must be enabled on both the client and server sides</em>"</h3>
<p>This error can occur when using the <span class="code">LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE</span> statement to load data into a MySQL 8 database. A change to the default settings introduced in MySQL 8 no longer allows local data to be loaded, for security purposes.</p>
<p>It is possible to load data using an alternate method. See the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215099117#local-infile-setting-mysql-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MySQL Overview</a> page for more details.</p>
