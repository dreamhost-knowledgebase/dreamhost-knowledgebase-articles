<p>The following are some potential issues that occasionally arise after an update:</p>
<h2>Common update issues</h2>
<h3>Plugin/theme conflict causing homepage errors</h3>
<p>Some issues you may see on your homepage are:</p>
<ul>
<li>white screen of death</li>
<li>'site experiencing difficulties'</li>
</ul>
<p>First, narrow down which plugin or theme is causing the issue. You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review your site's error logs</strong>: The <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216512197-Viewing-your-access-and-error-logs-via-SFTP" target="_self">error logs</a> may point to a theme or specific plugin causing the issue.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to a default theme</strong>: This is a quick way to confirm if the theme itself is causing the error.</li>
<li><strong>Toggle all plugins off</strong>: <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300817#Disabling_plugins" target="_self">Disabling all plugins </a>is a quick way to confirm if a plugin is causing the errors. You can then disable plugins one at a time until you find the one causing the error. If the plugin is not a vital part of the website (such as an unused plugin), you can safely leave it deactivated or uninstall it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WP Rollback Plugin</strong></p>
<p>If the source of the error is a vital part of the website (such as the theme or an important plugin), then you could try using the following plugin. This is an easy way to revert your site to the previous theme or plugin version:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Admin dashboard is inaccessible</h3>
<p>If you are unable to log into your WordPress site, you must instead review your site's error logs.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>If the logs specify a plugin, navigate to the plugin directory and disable it. View the following article for instructions on how to disable a plugin:</p>

</ul>
<p>Disabling a plugin often is enough to get the WordPress admin dashboard working again so you are able to log in.</p>
