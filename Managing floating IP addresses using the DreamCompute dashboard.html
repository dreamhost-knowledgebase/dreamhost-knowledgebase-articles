<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>This article is only relevant if you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/229789688-Private-networking-overview">private networking enabled</a>. If you are using public networking you will only have public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>
</div>
<p>When an instance is attached to a private network, it has a private, fixed IP address and can also have a public, or floating IP address. Private IP addresses are used for communication between instances, and public addresses are used for communication with networks outside the cloud, including the Internet.</p>
<p>When you launch an instance on a private network, it is automatically assigned a private IP address that stays the same until you explicitly delete the instance. Rebooting an instance has no effect on the private IP address.</p>
<p>A pool of floating IP addresses is available in DreamCompute. Your project's quota defines the maximum number of floating IP addresses that you can allocate to your project. After you allocate a floating IP address to your project, you can:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Associate the floating IP address with one of your instances (note: only one floating IP address can be allocated to an instance at any given time).</li>
<li>Disassociate a floating IP address from one of your instances.</li>
<li>Release a floating IP address from your project (this automatically deletes any associations that address has).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>List floating IP address information</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To see all the floating IP addresses that are allocated to your project:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>Log in to the <a href="https://iad2.dreamcompute.com/project/">DreamCompute Dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>In the left pane, select <span class="text-section">Network &gt; Floating IPs</span>.</li>

</dl>
<p>Here you can see the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The floating IP addresses that are allocated to your project</li>
<li>The fixed (or private) IP address of the instance the floating IP address is attached to (if it is attached)</li>
<li>The pool that the floating IP address came from</li>
<li>The current status of the floating IP address, and actions you can perform on the floating IP address.</li>
<li>Actions you can perform on the floating IP address</li>

<h2>Allocating floating IP addresses</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can assign a floating IP address to a project and to an instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your DreamCompute dashboard and navigate to the <span class="text-object">Floating IPs</span> tab.<br />

</li>
<li>To allocate a floating IP address to your project, start by clicking the <strong>Allocate IP To Project</strong> button on the <span class="text-object">Floating IPs</span> tab.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you have exceeded the quota of floating IP addresses for your account, you will need to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a> and ask them to increase your account's quota.</p>
