<p>This article is only relevant if you have <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/229789688-Private-networking-overview">private networking enabled</a>. If you are using public networking you will only have public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When an instance is attached to a private network, it has a private, fixed IP address and can also have a public, or floating IP address. Private IP addresses are used for communication between instances, and public addresses are used for communication with networks outside the cloud, including the Internet.</p>
<p>When you launch an instance on a private network, it is automatically assigned a private IP address that stays the same until you explicitly delete the instance. Rebooting an instance has no effect on the private IP address.</p>
<p>A pool of floating IP addresses is available in DreamCompute. Your project's quota defines the maximum number of floating IP addresses that you can allocate to your project. After you allocate a floating IP address to your project, you can:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Associate the floating IP address with one of your instances (note: only one floating IP address can be allocated to an instance at any given time).</li>
<li>Disassociate a floating IP address from one of your instances.</li>
<li>Release a floating IP address from your project (this automatically deletes any associations that address has).</li>
</ul>
