<h2>Viewing your DNS records in the panel</h2>

<p>You can review all of the DNS records that are set up for any site you host at DreamHost.</p>
<p>To view your DNS records:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.dashboard#!/grid-view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Websites</a>&nbsp;page.</li>

<h2>Viewing Nameservers</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the list of DNS records to view your nameservers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information is very handy if your domain points to non-DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> and you need to configure any or all of these records manually to point to DreamHost services.</p>
<p>If you are using DreamHost hosting services (including parking or a redirect of the site), and your domain is registered with DreamHost, you should use these nameservers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the nameservers are pointing to DreamHost, the records on your domain’s DNS page will be applied to your domain.</p>
</div>
<div id="check-dns-records" class="section-link">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Confirming where your domain's DNS is pointing</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The steps above confirm what your DreamHost DNS records are set to at DreamHost. However, this may be different than your domain's current DNS settings since they could still be pointing to a different company. View the following articles for more information on how to confirm where your domain and DNS are hosted:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>You can also check where your domain's DNS records are currently pointed on the <span class="panel-page">DNS Settings</span> page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the steps above under <span class="text-section">Viewing your DNS records in the panel</span> to open your site's <span class="panel-page">DNS Settings</span> page.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>DNS Checker</strong> button.
<dl>
<dd><em>The DNS Propagation Checker page opens.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click a record you wish to view and then click the <strong>Refresh</strong> or <strong>Go</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The DNS Propagation Checker page allows you to instantly perform a DNS lookup to check your website's current IP address and DNS record information against multiple nameservers located in different parts of the world.</p>
