<h2><span id="Private_key_doesn.27t_work">Private key doesn't work</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The most common case for a private key not working is that the permissions are set incorrectly on your <span class="text-object">.ssh</span> directory. In particular, the <span class="text-object">.ssh</span> directory, as well as your <span class="text-object">authorized_keys</span> file, must <strong>both</strong> be set to only be readable by your user. If you're having issues, please try running the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod 700 ~/.ssh</span>
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Too many failed attempts</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are receiving the error 'too many failed attempts' when attempting to log into your server via SSH, try adding the <span class="code">-v</span> flag to view the output of the connection. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">macbook$ </span><span class="command">ssh -v user@server.dreamhost.com</span></pre>
</div>
<p>In the output, look for lines with the text 'Trying private key' to view how many keys are being used to connect. Over time it's possible that too many were added to your SSH configuration causing the SSH agent to attempt too many keys before defaulting to Password Authentication. You can view and remove any outdated keys on your computer in the <span class="text-object">.ssh</span> directory.</p>
</div>
<h2>No password prompt appears after connecting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you do not see a password prompt after connecting to the server, make sure your username is configured as a shell user. View the following article for instructions on how to enable shell access on your user:</p>

<p>If you are having problems with your filenames or content not showing up correctly, you can add the following to your .bash_profile file to enable UTF support.&nbsp;View the&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006413028-Creating-and-editing-a-file-via-SSH">creating and editing a file via SSH</a>&nbsp;article for instructions on how to edit your existing .bash_profile.</p>

</div>
<p>UTF-8 is most likely enabled already. You can check in your terminal by entering the command <span class="code">locale</span>:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">locale</span> <br /><span class="cmdoutput">LANG=en_US.UTF-8 <br />LANGUAGE= <br />LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_COLLATE=C <br />LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8" <br />LC_ALL= </span></pre>
</div>
<p>You can see the first line is <span class="code">LANG=en_US.UTF-8</span>. If for some reason this still doesn’t work, it’s most likely the terminal client you’re using. For instructions on how to configure this in PuTTY please visit the following article:</p>

<h2><span id="Idle_connections_are_getting_dropped">Idle connections are getting dropped</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost and other ISPs may kill ssh connections that remain idle longer than a certain number of minutes. The fix is simple in Linux or OSX. All you need to do is set up keep-alive by editing the /etc/ssh/ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config file on your computer. In that file, add the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">  Host *
      ServerAliveInterval 15
      ServerAliveCountMax 4
</pre>
</div>
<p>Now, the ssh client asks the server for a sign of life every 15 seconds, thus keeping the connection open.</p>
