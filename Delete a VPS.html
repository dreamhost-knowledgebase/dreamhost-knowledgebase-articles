<p>When deleting your VPS, you can permanently delete all users and data or migrate everything to a different server. Ensure you follow the steps below carefully; otherwise, you could potentially lose data on your server.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HDPMKH7QS5R6CDYKAB5WJJX7">If you want to migrate your data to a different server</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This is most often the case when deleting a VPS. This can also be considered migrating your VPS data to a different hosting plan.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you wish to keep your website active and migrate it to a different hosting plan, you must already have a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Shared, Dedicated, or another VPS</a> Hosting plan active. Only then will you have the opportunity to migrate the data to this new server when you cancel.</p>
<p>If no other hosting service is in place, the website will go down, and your account will only be available for domain registrations.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure another hosting plan is active if you wish to keep your site up and running.</strong></p>

<p>You may not see the Delete button if your VPS RAM usage is too high. The usage needs to be lowered before you can delete a VPS. View the following article for more information on reducing VPS RAM memory usage:</p>

</li>
<li>Click the 'vertical 3 dots' button to the right of the server you wish to restart.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</li>
<li>Check the <span class="text-object">Transfer all data to another server</span> checkbox.</li>
<li>Select the server you want to migrate your data to from the <span class="text-object">Transfer to server</span> dropdown. This ensures your data is copied to the new server, where you'll continue to host your site.</li>
<li>Click the "Delete VPS" button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your data will begin to migrate to the new VPS. This could take some time, depending on how much data there is to transfer.</p>
<p>When finished, DreamHost emails the account owner to confirm the VPS has been deleted.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you have a MySQL VPS with 3GB or more of data and no Dedicated server, you cannot use the <strong>Delete</strong> button in the panel to delete your VPS. You must first decrease the size to less than 3GB for each MySQL VPS database to delete the VPS in the panel.</p>
</div>
<p>If you no longer need your server to host your websites, you can delete the VPS on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=server.dashboard#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Servers</a> page. Ensure you've backed up any necessary data first, as it will not be recoverable after deleting the server.</p>
