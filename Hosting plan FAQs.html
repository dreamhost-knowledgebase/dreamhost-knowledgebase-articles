<h2><span id="How_many_times_can_I_use_the_One-Click_Install_applications.3F">How many times can I use the One-Click Install applications?</span></h2>
<p>You can use them as many times as you want. You can install it on the parent domain, subdomain, or subdirectory and uninstall whenever you like. Always be sure when you’re about to run a One-Click installer that the directory you’re installing into is empty or the install will fail.</p>
<h2>How many sites can I set up a hosting plan?</h2>
<p>It depends on the plan. For Shared, VPS, and Dedicated hosting, you can add as many domains as you like.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a>, each plan is only set up for a single domain, so if you want multiple domains on DreamPress, you must purchase a DreamPress plan for each domain.</p>
