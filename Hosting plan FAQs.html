<h2 id="h_01HEK8KGPB286GZ5DAZ6C9PQ60">How many sites can I set up with a hosting plan?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It depends on the plan. For Shared, VPS, and Dedicated Hosting, you can add as many domains as you like.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a>, each plan is only set up for a single domain, so if you want multiple domains on DreamPress, you must purchase a DreamPress plan for each domain.</p>
