<p>This article is a brief summary of permissions that can be assigned to files and folders at DreamHost. If necessary, view the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a> article for instructions on how to log in to your server depending on your operating system.</p>
<h2><span id="User_and_Group" class="mw-headline">User and Group</span></h2>
<p>Every file in a Unix system is assigned both a user and a group. The following sections detail the ownership of each.</p>
<h3><span id="User" class="mw-headline">User</span></h3>
<p>Every file in Unix is assigned a user.</p>
<p>This user:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the owner of the file.</li>
<li>has permission to change the group and mode of the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>No one else (but the administrator) is able to make these changes, and only the administrator can change the owner of a file.</p>
<p>The command to change the owner is chown:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chown exampleuser file.txt</span></pre>
</div>
<p>The user named "exampleuser " now owns "file.txt". This only works if you’re the superuser.</p>
<p>The work-around to change the file owner for non-superusers is to copy the file(s) to a new location where, as the user, you wish to own the files. The files are owned by this user in the new location. It's not much of a work-around, but it's occasionally useful.</p>
<p>More information regarding the chown command can be found <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chown" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h3><span id="Group" class="mw-headline">Group</span></h3>
<p>Every file in Unix is assigned a group. This is the "group owner" of the file. Unix groups allow you to grant access to a number of users. You can create Unix Groups in your panel on the (<a class="external text" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.groups&amp;" rel="nofollow">Panel &gt; ‘Users’ &gt; ‘Unix Groups’</a>) page.</p>
<p>The command to modify the group is chgrp. You may only modify the group of files you own, and you can only set the group owner to the name of a group of which you are a member:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chgrp examplegroup file.txt</span></pre>
</div>
<p>The group named " examplegroup" now owns "file.txt".</p>
