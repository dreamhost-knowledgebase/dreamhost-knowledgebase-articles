<p>DreamObjects is an object storage system with infinite capacity. Think of it as a bottomless pit where you can continue to add files without having to worry about filling it up. Files are stored as <cite>objects</cite> into <cite>buckets</cite>. View the following article from Wikipedia for further details on Object Storage:</p>

<h2>What file types can be stored?</h2>
<p>DreamObjects can be used to store files such as photos, songs, documents, backups, and more without worrying about filling up disk space. It's capable of storing almost any type of file, so long as it meets the conditions of the <a class="reference external" href="http://dreamhost.com/acceptable-use-policy/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Though DreamObjects doesn't support server-side encryption, it is secure since the only way to access its data is through an access and secret key (comparable to an FTP/shell username and password, but randomly generated by DreamHost). Additionally, you can employ client-side encryption by encrypting the data at your location and then using SSL to upload the data to DreamObjects.</p>
