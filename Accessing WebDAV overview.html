<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216660108-WebDAV-overview">WebDAV</a> is essentially a collaborative way for users to edit and manage files on a remote web server. From <a class="new" title="W:WebDAV (page does not exist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV on Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<div class="text-blockquote">
<p>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring operations.</p>
</div>
<p>This guide describes the required steps to connect to a <span class="text-object">WebDAV</span> directory.</p>
</div>
<p>The DreamHost panel allows you to specify which users have access to a WebDAV-enabled directory. However, by default, each user has full access to all files in the entire directory. This may not be an issue with a very simple WebDAV directory, but as the WebDAV directory grows in users, certain problems may arise. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no file-level security.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>– Users can potentially overwrite edits by another user and even delete another user's file.</dd>
<dd>– Any files intended to be private are viewable by all users of the folder.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>User management cannot be done automatically (e.g., no adding users via PHP scripts).</li>
</ul>
<p>The best solution is to specify access levels (Access-Control-Lists) on a per-folder (or maybe even per-file) basis. As the user count grows, you can then manage the users and passwords list automatically using scripts.</p>
<p>This can be done by creating/editing an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216363187-Password-protecting-your-site-with-an-htaccess-file">.htaccess</a> file placed in every folder where you want to make an exception.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You must have the following three basic pieces of information in order to connect:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The WebDAV site URL</strong> – This is the URL you will be connecting to. This information can be obtained in the web panel under <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=advanced.webdav&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Htaccess/WebDAV</a>.
<ul>
<li>The DreamHost control panel requires WebDAV to be set up on a real subfolder of the root of a domain (not in the root of a domain). This can be worked around via manual configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The WebDAV account username and password</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>A nickname for the connection/shortcut</strong> – This is to remind you of the site you are connecting to.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HYPDG4ZAJP4KY4P89XEXVXD9"><span id="Alternative_WebDAV_client_software">Alternative WebDAV client software</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can use alternative clients which have additional features including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>local caching</strong> – to avoid round trips to the server, which may be slow for you or expensive for the server</li>
<li><strong>offline access</strong> – for work while you are disconnected</li>
<li><strong>versioning</strong> – custom permissions, or other features your WebDAV server may offer only through a more advanced client</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternate (and sometimes non-free) clients include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.webdavsystem.com/">Map Drive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://webdrive.com/">Web Drive</a></li>
</ul>
