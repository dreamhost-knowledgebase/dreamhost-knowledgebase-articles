<h2><span id="FTP_security">Overview</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>FTP (port 21) is not considered a "secure" protocol. This means that incoming/outgoing data is unencrypted and in plain text. Because the data is unencrypted, an exceptionally sneaky person could eavesdrop on what you're sending.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's only recommended that you create an <a href="#Setting_an_existing_user_to_SFTP">SFTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385837-Creating-a-user-with-Shell-SSH-access">Shell</a> user and use port 22 when connecting.</p>

<h2><span id="Difference_between_FTP_and_SFTP">Difference between FTP and SFTP</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>SFTP is a network protocol designed to provide secure file transfer over the secure shell (<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>) protocol. SFTP is NOT just FTP run over SSH, but rather a new protocol. It is often called Secure FTP because it uses an encrypted transport layer.</p>

<h2><span id="Notes_on_using_SFTP">Notes on using SFTP</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When logging in to your account using SFTP you may notice some differences from what you would normally see when you logged in with a normal FTP user.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may notice that you can also access other directories above the <span class="text-object">/home</span> directory. That's normal, as all users have some level of access to those directories. However, as a regular user you won't be able to view files that you don't have access to, nor are you able to harm the server.</li>
<li><strong><span id="hidden_files">Hidden files/directories</span></strong>: On a Unix system, hidden files are those that begin with a period (.) in their name. As with FTP clients, SFTP clients usually have an option to "enable/disable viewing hidden files". If that is enabled, you'll be able to see these files/directories (if your user has permissions to do so). If you are having problems deleting a directory (assuming you have the correct permissions to delete) and it gives you an error saying "directory not empty", it may be that there are hidden files/directories in that directory that your client is not allowing you to see. Check your program options before going any further. If you do have the option enabled to view hidden files/directories and still cannot delete a directory, please contact support for assistance. Give support the server, user account, and full path to the directory you are trying to delete so they can investigate. View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613037-How-to-view-hidden-files-in-an-FTP-client">How do I show hidden files?</a> article for further information.</li>
