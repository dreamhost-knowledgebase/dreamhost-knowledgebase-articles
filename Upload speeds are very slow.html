<p>This article provides an overview of what can be causing slow uploads to your site, or what can be preventing you from uploading in general.</p>
<h2><span id="Does_DreamHost_limit_upload_speeds.3F">Does DreamHost limit upload speeds?</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost does not limit upload speeds. The only limitation is the router hardware that connects the server to the Internet. At the moment, DreamHost servers use 10/1000 ethernet connections, so it is highly unlikely that you are maxing out the ethernet port.</p>
<p>The most common causes of problems when uploading are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network connection is bad</li>
<li>Local Internet is slow</li>
<li>You have a firewall program that is blocking you</li>
<li>Your router is blocking you</li>
</ul>
<p>There can be other reasons, but these are the most common issues.</p>
<h2><span id="Network_connection_is_bad">Network connection is bad</span></h2>
<p>If you can upload, but the speed is slow, the reason may be that your connection to the site is timing out. It’s also possible the upload speed is getting bottlenecked by your local Internet provider.</p>
<h3><span id="Running_a_traceroute">Running a traceroute</span></h3>
<p>Running a traceroute lets you detect connection problems between your location and the server. If you see that hops are timing out, this is something you need to contact your ISP about as it can be impacting your upload speeds. You can read more about how traceroutes work and how to run them here:</p>

<h3><span id="Check_your_Internet_speed">Check your Internet speed</span></h3>
<p>The speed at which your data uploads is limited by the speed at which your computer can upload to the Internet. Check your connection speed here:</p>

</ul>
<p>If the results provided in the test are unsatisfactory, you need to speak to your ISP about steps you can take to improve the speed.</p>
<h2><span id="I_can.E2.80.99t_connect_using_FTP_at_all">I can’t connect using FTP at all</span></h2>
<p>In the event that the FTP connection fails to allow you to upload at all, it is likely that something on your local network or computer is blocking the connection. Try disabling your firewall. Many firewalls block access to port 21 which is used by FTP. If you turn off your firewall and the FTP connection works, then you need to adjust your firewall settings to allow port 21 (or port 22 for SFTP).</p>
<p>Routers can also block port 21. If turning off your firewall doesn’t resolve the issue, make sure your router is configured to allow access to port 21. If your firewall and router are set to allow access but you still cannot upload, then please contact DreamHost support for further assistance.</p>
<h3><span id="Uploading_errors_on_a_website">Uploading errors on a website</span></h3>
<p>If uploads are failing when you are using a WordPress plugin, or any other alternate PHP-based uploading solution for your site, you could be hitting the limits of your PHP settings. If you get 500 errors when trying to upload, or the site spins endlessly and nothing happens, this may be the case. You may wish to add a custom phprc to your site to increase upload limits and execution times.</p>
