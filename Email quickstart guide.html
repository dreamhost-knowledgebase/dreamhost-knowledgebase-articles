<p>One of the best things about having your own domain is that you get to have any personal address you like for that domain which looks more professional than a generic mail address, such as @gmail.com.</p>
<p>Adding an email address takes only a few simple steps which this guide explains. However, if you need further details on other aspects of an email address, please review the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038-Email-client-configuration-overview">Email Client Configuration</a> article.</p>

<h2>Logging into your email address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two ways to log into your email address.</p>
<ul>
<li>Webmail</li>
<li>Email client</li>
</ul>
<h3>Webmail</h3>
<p>Webmail is the easiest option to log into your your email address. Just visit the following link to log in.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webmail.dreamhost.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://webmail.dreamhost.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more about webmail at the following link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216540008-Webmail-overview" target="_self">Webmail overview</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Email client</h3>
<p>An email client (Mac Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird, iPhone, Android) offers you more control over managing your email but requires you to manually configure it first. The following articles guide you through the general configuration process.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918038-Email-client-configuration-overview">Email client configuration overview</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215612887-Email-client-protocols-and-port-numbers">Email client protocols and port numbers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>View the following section for a list of the most common email clients:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h2><span id="Possible_errors">Possible errors</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The steps above assume your DNS is hosted with DreamHost. If you have custom <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215035328-Configuring-custom-MX-records" target="_self" rel="undefined">MX records</a> in place for a domain, you will not be able to create new addresses. This is because if you are using Gmail, (or another alternative mail provider), you must create new email addresses at that provider.</p>
<p>Another issue to be aware of is that sometimes when you have a large number of addresses already created, you get an error message that says:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">“Your account cannot create additional e-mail addresses at this time. 

This is usually a temporary situation and should be resolved within 24 hours.

Please contact Support if you have any questions.”

<p>In the event you get this message, please <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact support</a>.</p>
