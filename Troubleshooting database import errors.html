<h2>ERROR 1044</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>MySQL databases can be exported into a single file which you can then use to migrate the database to another hosting company.</p>
<p>Very often, this MySQL file contains a <span class="code">CREATE DATABASE</span> and a <span class="code">USE</span> statement. These statements are intended to automate the process of migrating the database to a new location, however, attempting to import your database to DreamHost with such a file will fail as you do not have <span class="code">CREATE DATABASE</span> permissions.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>When you import a database with these statements via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221614988-SSH-Importing-a-database" target="_self">SSH</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214395768-phpMyAdmin-How-to-import-a-database-or-table" target="_self">phpMyAdmin</a>, you'll see the following error message:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'your_user_name'@'yourhost/hostmask' to database 'newdbname'</pre>
</div>
<p>This error message indicates that you don't have sufficient permissions to create the new database and is caused by the <span class="code">CREATE DATABASE</span> statement in the MySQL file being imported.</p>
<p>The only way to create a database at DreamHost is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/221691727-Creating-a-MySQL-database" target="_self">in the panel</a>. Because of this, the <span class="code">CREATE DATABASE</span> statement that is in your MySQL file is not needed.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>To resolve this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the MySQL file in a text editor (not a word processor, such as MS-Word).</li>
<li>Delete the lines that begin with <span class="code">CREATE DATABASE</span> and <span class="code">USE</span>. For example:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">CREATE DATABASE `newdbname` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_c$ USE `newdbname`;</pre>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>and</em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">USE `newdbname`;</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-tip">
<ul>
<li>The exact text of the <span class="code">CREATE DATABASE</span> statement differs depending on the database name and the character set used.</li>
<li>Make sure to delete everything from the beginning of the line through, and including, the semi-colon at the end of the line.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>Once you have deleted these statements, save your edited MySQL file, and then try importing again.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>ERROR 1227</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you restore a MySQL backup to a database under another user and have any 'views' in your database, you'll get an error similar to this:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">ERROR 1227 (42000) at line 694: Access denied; you need the SUPER privilege for this operation.</pre>
</div>
<p>You'll need to remove&nbsp;the <span class="code">DEFINER</span> mentioned in the <span class="text-object">.sql</span> file at the line specified in the error.</p>
