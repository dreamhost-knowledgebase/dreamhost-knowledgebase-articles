<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A hosting plan is a product you must purchase in order for your website to display online. When you purchase a hosting plan, you are assigned a server. You are then able to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215613657-How-do-I-upload-my-site-to-DreamHost-" target="_self">upload your website</a> to the server. If the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview" target="_self">DNS records</a> for your website are pointed to DreamHost, your site will then load online from your new DreamHost server.</p>
<h3>DreamHost hosting plans</h3>
<p>DreamHost offers several different types of hosting plans running on the Ubuntu operating system. Most sites work well on the basic Shared Hosting plan, however, if your site is getting a large amount of traffic or if you need to make customizations not available to shared users, you may need to upgrade to a VPS, Dedicated, or DreamPress plan.</p>
<p>You can find further details at <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/">DreamHost Hosting</a> which describes the various options available to you as a DreamHost customer.</p>
<h3><span id="Bandwidth">Bandwidth usage</span></h3>
<p>Bandwidth usage at Dreamhost is unmetered on all hosting plans except for <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216745398-Cloud-Services-panel" target="_self">cloud services</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2>What if my domain is registered at another company?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can still host your site at DreamHost if your registration was purchased at another company. You just need to point your DNS to DreamHost. The other option would be to transfer the registration to your DreamHost account. View the following articles for further details:</p>

<h2>Shared Starter hosting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Shared Starter is DreamHost's introductory Shared Hosting plan that's geared for users who are new to web hosting. It's also a perfect solution for a personal or business website that displays simple information about yourself or services that you offer.</p>
<h3>What's included?</h3>
<p>Since this is a starter plan, there are a few limitations that don't exist with a regular Shared plan. For example, a Shared Starter plan offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 domain you can use for your website (e.g., <strong>example.com</strong>)</li>
<li>5 subdomains of your single domain name (e.g., <strong>blog.example.com</strong>)</li>
<li>Email is not included â€” an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360024060072-Paid-email-plan" target="_self">email plan</a>&nbsp;is available for an extra charge</li>
<li>Site storage is limited to 50GB</li>
<li>A maximum of 6 FTP/SFTP/Shell users</li>
<li>A maximum of 6 MySQL databases</li>
</ul>
<h3>Refund policy</h3>
<p>Refunds on Shared Starter follow the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215206997-Refunds-and-Account-Credits" target="_self">same policy as a regular Shared Hosting plan</a>.</p>

<h2>Shared Hosting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On a shared server, you 'share' server space with other customers. Though no other customer has access to your files, you and the other customers share the resources of the server. This means that if another website on the same server is receiving a large amount of traffic and using a lot of CPU resources, it's possible that your site may run slower as a result.</p>
<p>While DreamHost works hard to make sure all sites on a shared server never disrupt other sites, this is always a possibility due to the nature of Shared Hosting.</p>
<p>View the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/shared/">Shared Hosting page</a> for current plan options.</p>
<h3><span id="What_can_I_host_on_shared_hosting.3F">What can I host on Shared Hosting?</span></h3>
<p>Shared Hosting is perfect for blogs, portfolios, personal/business sites, and database-driven sites. Visit the following page for further information:</p>

</ul>
<h3>Non-Profit discount</h3>
<p>Shared Hosting plans offer a free Non-Profit plan for qualifying non-profit, charitable organizations registered in the United States. View the following article for further information:</p>

<h2>VPS hosting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The DreamHost Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a premium hosting plan available as an add-on to an existing <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-" target="_self">DreamHost plan</a> or a standalone service.</p>
<p>DreamHost VPSs use Linux-Containers (LXC) to create a "virtual" server that protects a user's RAM resources from other users on the same physical machine.</p>
<h3><span id="Comparison_of_Shared_and_VPS_hosting">Comparison of Shared and VPS hosting</span></h3>
<p>On a shared server, resources are shared by other users. On a VPS, these resources are more isolated which improves performance and helps to maintain stability.</p>
<p>You also have the ability to control how much RAM your server uses. On a shared plan, this is limited to a specific amount; but on a VPS, you get to select how much RAM is available for your server to use.</p>
<h3><span id="What_can_I_host_on_a_private_server.3F">What can I host on a private server?</span></h3>
<p>A VPS is ideal for websites that require more resources than a shared server can provide, yet do not need the full power of a Dedicated Server. It's ideal for businesses, eCommerce, designers, and developers.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>View the <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/vps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPS Hosting page</a> for current plan options.</p>
</div>
<h2>Dedicated</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A Dedicated server is a server that is completely dedicated to your data alone. This means no other DreamHost customers have any access to or share any resources with your sites on that server.</p>
<p>You have full root access to customize it any way you wish, but please note that DreamHost support cannot assist if any errors occur as a result of a customization.</p>
<p>Another feature is that your MySQL server is on the <em>same</em> Dedicated Server allowing faster access, unlike with all other hosting plans where your MySQL databases are on a separate database server.</p>
<p>View the following page for further details on Dedicated Hosting plans:</p>

<h2>DreamPress</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214581158-DreamPress-overview">DreamPress</a> is DreamHost's Managed WordPress hosting. It's a scalable service that allows users to manage their WordPress sites with simple pricing, added benefits of server robustness, caching, and memory.</p>
<p>One DreamPress plan is configured for a single domain. If you want multiple domains on DreamPress, they must each have their own separate DreamPress hosting plan activated.</p>
<p>DreamPress uses both a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> for the webserver and a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215945917-MySQL-VPS-overview">private database server</a> for your database. This is different from a standard <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> service where your databases are still on a shared database server.</p>

<h2>MySQL hosting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>With any Shared or VPS hosting plan, you also have free access to a shared MySQL server. This Shared MySQL server can store all of your databases for all of your websites. Since it's a shared server, resources are 'shared' with other customer in the same way as a shared web server mentioned above.</p>
<p>If you need more database resources than the Shared MySQL server can offer, you can purchase a private MySQL server.</p>
