<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article gives you a few suggestions on how to identify memory issues and optimize your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">DreamHost VPS</a>. This will help it use less memory, saving you money while speeding up your websites.</p>

<h2>Blocking abusive bots</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A common problem for websites is caused by search engine indexing bots repeatedly hitting the website.</p>
<h3>Create a robots.txt file</h3>
<p>To minimize the issue of abusive bots, you should set up a <span class="text-object">robots.txt</span> file. This file helps to control what bots are allowed to search and how often.</p>

</ul>
<h3>View your access.log file</h3>
<p>Finding abusive bots can often be more of an art than a science, but you can get some data on this by analyzing the <span class="text-object">access.log</span> file for your websites.&nbsp;View the following article for detailed information on how to check your <span class="text-object">access.log</span> file and see where the most traffic is coming from:</p>

<h2><span id="Preventing_image_hotlinking">Preventing image hotlinking</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Hotlinking is when another website uses an image from your website. They do this by using your website's full image URL on their own site.&nbsp;This can cause massive problems for your site, as even a relatively low-traffic site can cause poor server performance.</p>
<p>View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216363197-Prevent-image-hotlinking" target="_self" rel="undefined">Prevent image hotlinking</a> article for more information on how to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h2><span id="Caching_your_site">Caching your site</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Caching helps to store website files, making them faster to access by your visitors. Ensure your website's software uses some caching functionality to prevent memory issues and improve overall performance.</p>
<h3>PHP processes</h3>
<p>PHP processes can take up a significant amount of memory. If your site is getting a lot of traffic, enabling caching will help reduce the number of PHP processes spawned.</p>
<p>Caching renders a PHP script and then "caches" that HTML output as a file. The next time that page is accessed, the server outputs the static HTML page rather than processing the PHP script again.</p>
<h3>Cloudflare</h3>
<p>You can also enable a 3rd party service like <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/7087974733332-Create-a-free-Cloudflare-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloudflare</a>, which provides additional caching options for your websites if you expect a large volume of visitors.</p>

<h2><span id="Enabling_FastCGI_and_XCache">Enabling OPcache for PHP sites</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>OPcache is a caching engine built into PHP that, when enabled, dramatically increases the performance of PHP-based websites. <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">View the following article for details on how to enable this feature:</span></p>

<h2><span id="WordPress-specific_optimizations">WordPress-specific optimizations</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're running multiple instances of the WordPress software on your VPS, review the <a href="/hc/en-us/sections/203242637" target="_self" rel="undefined">WordPress Optimization</a> category for detailed articles.</p>
<p>Make sure to do the following with each installation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always run the most recent version of WordPress.</li>
<li>Install only essential plugins.</li>
<li>Keep your plugins up-to-date.</li>
<li>Remove/delete unused plugins as opposed to just deactivating them.</li>
<li>Confirm your active theme isn't generating any errors in your <span class="text-object">error.log</span> file (located in the same directory as the <span class="text-object">access.log</span>).</li>
<li>View <a href="https://www.die.net/musings/page_load_time/">Optimizing Page Load Time</a> and make sure you have a popular WordPress caching plugin installed and configured. For example, W3TC or WP Super Cache.</li>
<li>Finally, compressing your image files improves loading time and reduces overall memory usage.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="IP_Tables">Configuring IP Tables</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It is not possible to customize IP tables on a DreamHost VPS. This is because VPSs run on a single host machine where IP tables are configured, but there is no access to this machine.</p>
<p>If you need to run your own custom IP tables, the only option would be to upgrade to a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-server-overview" target="_self">Dedicated Server</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214840947-What-is-DreamCompute-" target="_self">DreamCompute</a> and manually install this software.</p>
