<p>Nginx (pronounced engine-x) is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. It's known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.</p>
<p>As of September 2015, Nginx hosts nearly 12.18% (22.2M) of active sites across all domains. It powers several high-visibility sites, such as Netflix, Hulu, Pinterest, Cloudflare, Airbnb, WordPress.com, GitHub, SoundCloud, Zynga, Eventbrite, Zappos, Media Temple, Heroku, RightScale, Engine Yard, and MaxCDN</p>

<p>Nginx is available on DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">Private Servers</a> as an optional web server to run your sites.</p>

<p>All DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">private servers</a> use Apache by default instead of Nginx. This is because Apache supports a larger toolbox of things it can do immediately and is probably the most compatible across all web software out there today.</p>
<p>However, Nginx is a very good choice in cases where you have a site that gets large volumes of traffic and is running into performance/memory issues on a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a>. A server running Nginx serves your site faster while using less memory than Apache. This lets you handle a much larger amount of traffic more gracefully than Apache would.

<h2><span id="Gzip_compression">Gzip compression</span></h2>
<p>By default, gzip compression is enabled on your Nginx server. Follow these steps to disable gzip compression:</p>
<ol>
<li>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216455077-Nginx-configuration-file-locations">Local configuration files</a> article to create your local <code>/nginx/example.com</code> directory.</li>
<li>Create a file named settings.conf in this <code>/nginx/example.com</code> directory.</li>
<li>Add the following content:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">gzip off;
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<p>Many web applications such as WordPress and MediaWiki are originally configured to work with Apache. Since .htaccess files are not supported with Nginx, there are some adjustments you must make in order to get your applications running properly.</p>
