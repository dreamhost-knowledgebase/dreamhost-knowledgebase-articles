<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you would like to purchase an SSL certificate from another company, make sure to first create a CSR at DreamHost before requesting it from your chosen Certificate Authority. That company will then be able to use this CSR to generate your SSL certificate.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HC654JXGCJSW5FP9DC8W219A">What if I already have my certificate information?</h3>
<p>If you already have a private key, intermediate certificate, and signed SSL certificate, you will still need to have a CSR created at DreamHost before installing. You can then give this CSR to your Certificate Authority who will re-issue the certificate to you. You can then use these new files to install them into your DreamHost panel.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HC654JXG88CZ4S9QTMEZ4Z3R">Make sure you have the private key</h3>
<p>If you already have a signed SSL certificate but do NOT have the corresponding private key, you won't be able to install it on DreamHost's servers. Also, do NOT create a private key that is password-protected, as the DreamHost panel does not accept these.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Some Certificate Authorities put all the SSL certificate files into a <span class="text-object">.zip</span> file for you. To view the files, make sure to first decompress the zip file.</p>
<p>On a Mac, double click the file.</p>
<p>In Windows, right-click and select 'Extract All'.</p>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you see the error message "key does not match cert", that means that the SSL certificate you're trying to install does not match the private key that is currently installed. This typically means that the Certificate Signing Request that was used to purchase the SSL certificate was not generated with the private key that is in the panel.</p>
