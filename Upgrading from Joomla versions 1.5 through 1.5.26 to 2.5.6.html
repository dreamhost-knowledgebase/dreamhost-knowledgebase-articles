</ol>
<p><strong>Notes on upgrading to Joomla version 2.5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You may receive the following error when performing the migration: "Error: zip file was not found." It's a known bug with the jUpgrade plugin – to fix, try running the migration again as it may take several attempts to successfully perform the migration.</li>
<li>The original installation remains in the same directory—the migration to Joomla! 2.5 is in a new sub folder.</li>
<li>The upgraded site is in the <strong>jupgrade/</strong> folder with the default theme for Joomla! 2.5.</li>
<li>The administrator panel is in the <strong>jupgrade/administrator/</strong> folder.</li>
<li><em><strong>You must move the files from the sub folder over to the root of your domain. Failing to do so will result in not being able to use the 'One-Click Installer to upgrade'.</strong></em></li>
<li>You can find a YouTube video about this <a class=" " href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTOdQNDpQVQ" rel="nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
