<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A 'hosts' file is a text file on your home computer. It is used to map a domain name to a specific server. If you edit it, you can change where your computer searches for a website.</p>
<p>For example, when you look up a URL in your browser, your computer sends out a query into the Internet to find where your site is located. Your site is located where your DNS is pointed to. If you edit the 'hosts' file, you can change where your computer searches for a website.</p>
<p>In this way you can view a site on your DreamHost server when the DNS is pointed to another company.</p>

<p>This article explains how to view your site before pointing your DNS to DreamHost by editing the 'hosts' file on your <strong>desktop or laptop</strong>&nbsp;computer (not a mobile device).</p>
<p>To test on a mobile device, or for another option on how to view your site at DreamHost before pointing DNS, view the following article:</p>

<h2><strong><span id="Locate_your_A_records">Locate your A records</span></strong></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each site at DreamHost has two A records for the URL. One for your domain with and without www. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>208.113.137.245 example.com</li>
<li>208.113.137.245 www.example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> article for details on how to view these records. Make a note of these as you'll need to add the IP to your 'hosts' file in the next step.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>On most Windows systems, you can find the hosts file in the following directory:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc</pre>
</div>
<p>It might be set to hidden so make sure you have <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files#show-hidden-files=windows-7">'show hidden files'</a> turned on.</p>
<p>Notepad is a basic text editing program that is already install on Windows. To open the 'hosts' file with Notepad, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the 'Start' menu.

</li>
<li>In the search box, type in 'notepad'.</li>
<li>Right click on the 'Notepad' option and choose 'Run as administrator'.
<dl>
<dd><em>This opens a blank Notepad file</em></dd>

</div>
</li>
<li>Save the file.</li>
<li>Finally, make sure to flush your computer's DNS to ensure the new settings update.

<h2><span id="WordPress_migration_instructions">WordPress migration instructions</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This section explains how to view your WordPress site (at DreamHost) if it was migrated by the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004182807">Professional Services Team</a>. This section only applies to NON-DreamPress migrations.</p>
<p>First, read through the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006086308">sections&nbsp;above</a> to locate and edit your computer's 'hosts' file.</p>
<p>Normally, updating a 'hosts' file only requires you to add two lines (as mentioned above). With this migration process, you also need to add a third line of text for the MySQL server. For example, if your site was example.com, you would add these lines to the bottom of your 'hosts' file:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">111.111.111.111 example.com
111.111.111.111 www.example.com
222.222.222.222 mysql.example.com</pre>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace the example IP addresses above with your site's actual</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;IP addresses. You can find them in the DreamHost web panel on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> page. Under your domain name, click 'DNS' link.</span></p>
<p>If you need further assistance locating your site's IP addresses, view the '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">' article for more detailed instructions.</span></p>
<h3>Confirming the 'hosts' file is working</h3>
<p>You can confirm you are loading the migrated site from DreamHost's servers if you are able to load the following page (replacing “example.com” with your domain):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>http://example.com/quickstart.html</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>View your public site through a proxy</h3>
<p>Once your 'hosts' file is working, your computer will show you how your site looks at DreamHost. If you want to also view your current (public) site, you must use a proxy website.</p>
<p>An example of a proxy site is <a href="http://kproxy.com/">http://kproxy.com</a>. Visit that link in your browser, enter your domain name in the box, then click 'Enter'. It uses your site's public DNS (not your local 'hosts' file) to view the site at your current hosting company.</p>
<h3>Comparing the sites</h3>
<p>Viewing your site using a 'hosts' file and a proxy site allows you to view both versions of your site for a side by side comparison. You can have one browser tab open on the migrated site (viewed using your 'hosts' file) and another browser tab open on the proxy site (viewed using DNS) to see your current public site.</p>
<h3>Making further changes to your site</h3>
<p>During your inspection of the site, you may feel the need to change the setting of something that was out of scope of the migration service. Please refrain from changing anything that may alter the look or behavior of the site since the Professional Services Team must be able to compare the migrated site (at DreamHost) to the live site (at your current host).</p>
<p>If you must update something, make sure to document any change so the Professional Services Team can separate what may have been affected by the migration from subsequent alterations on your end.</p>
