<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you're seeing that sent or received emails especially within the same domain are landing in a spam folder, it may be due to your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) blacklisted IP address. DreamHost's spam filters are designed to mark emails as spam when they originate from a blacklisted IP address.</p>
<p>The following provides steps you can take to determine if your IP address is on a blacklist.</p>
</div>
<h2>Looking up your IP address</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatismyipaddress.com</a> &nbsp;to look up your current home IP address.</li>
<li>Use the following sites to check if your IP address is on a blacklist:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://multirbl.valli.org/" target="_self" rel="undefined">multirbl.valli.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://zy0.de/" target="_self" rel="undefined">zy0.de</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your IP address is on a blacklist, contact your ISP (the company providing you with internet access) to determine any steps you can take in order to remove it.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>What if my IP address is not on a blacklist?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your IP address is not blacklisted, then please copy the headers of the message that ended up in your spam folder and paste it into a <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support ticket</a> in your DreamHost panel.

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Third-party email providers</h3>
<p>If your domain is using a third-party email provider but using DreamHost's DNS, make sure you have configured the correct <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216106197-How-do-I-add-an-SPF-record-" target="_self">custom SPF records</a>.</p>
<h3>Sending email from your website</h3>
<p>If you are sending email from your website and those messages are going to spam, make sure the email is authenticated via SMTP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WordPress:</strong> You can use a plugin such as '<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215526937-Configuring-the-WP-Mail-SMTP-plugin" target="_self">WP Mail SMTP</a>' to send SMTP-authenticated emails.</li>
<li><strong>PHP:</strong> If your site uses the PHP mail function, you can configure it to use SMTP via packages like <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215842658-PHPmailer-overview" target="_self">PHPMailer</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216140597-How-do-I-send-PHP-mail-via-SMTP-" target="_self">PEAR</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Other CMS:</strong> If your site has a CMS other than WordPress installed, it may have built-in support for SMTP authentication. Refer to your software's support documentation for more information.</li>
</ul>
