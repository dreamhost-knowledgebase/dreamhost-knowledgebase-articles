<p>If you're seeing that sent or received emails especially within the same domain are landing in a spam folder, it may be due to your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) blacklisted IP address. DreamHost's spam filters are designed to mark email as spam when they originate from a blacklisted IP address.</p>
<p>The following provides steps you can take to determine if your IP address is on a blacklist.</p>
<h2>Looking up your IP address</h2>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://whatismyip.host/my-ip-address-details">http://whatismyip.host/my-ip-address-details</a> to look up your current home IP address.</li>
<li>Use the following sites to check if your IP address is on a blacklist:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://multirbl.valli.org/">http://multirbl.valli.org/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://zy0.de/">http://zy0.de/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your IP address is on a blacklist, contact your ISP (the company providing you with internet access) to determine any steps you can take in order to remove it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What if my IP address is not on a blacklist?</h2>
<p>If your IP address is not blacklisted, then please copy the headers of the message that ended up in your spam folder and paste it into a <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;">support ticket</a> in your DreamHost panel.
