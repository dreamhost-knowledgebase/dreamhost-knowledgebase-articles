<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost offers Cloudflare plans on any hosting plan. You can find more information in the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215873088-Cloudflare-overview" target="_self">Cloudflare Overview</a> article. However, because DreamPress is a managed WordPress hosting plan, please be aware of the following items specific to using Cloudflare on DreamPress.</p>

<h2>Setting up Cloudflare partner plans on DreamPress</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To enable Cloudflare partner plans, please <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;" target="_self">Contact Support</a> using the DreamPress category to begin the process.</p>
<p>If you wish to enable Cloudflare yourself without DreamHost Support’s involvement, you can also sign up for Cloudflare’s plans directly at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_self">cloudflare.com</a>. You will need to modify your nameservers and manage your DNS records yourself, instead of having DreamHost manage DNS for you using DreamHost nameservers.</p>
<h3>Additional setup</h3>
<p>It is highly recommended to install the Proxy Cache Purge plugin on your DreamPress site. While Proxy Cache Purge is installed by default on all new DreamPress sites, if you migrate an existing WordPress site to DreamPress, the plugin files might be overwritten. You can install it yourself if your DreamPress site doesn’t have the plugin:</p>

</ul>
<p>If you have the plugin installed and activated, visit the “Proxy Cache” menu in your WP-Admin to verify that the “Set Custom IP” field says <strong>localhost</strong>. If not, change the field to localhost and click the “Save IP” button.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>On older DreamPress machines (before August 2017), this field should be the IP address of the DreamPress server.</p>

<p>If you are noticing any strange caching or performance issues, the Cloudflare plugin, also available in the WordPress.org repository, can help optimize your site’s performance with Cloudflare. However, this plugin is not mandatory.</p>

<h2>Pros and cons of using Cloudflare on DreamPress</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress includes built-in <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215300647-Managing-the-DreamPress-cache" target="_self">server caching</a> to make your pages load very quickly, which acts as a “reverse proxy” in the same way that Cloudflare does. Working on your site with Cloudflare active on DreamPress can sometimes be tricky since Cloudflare is caching a site that is already cached using the same method. You can reduce this effect by enabling Development mode on both Cloudflare and the Proxy Cache Purge plugin.</p>
<p>If you would like an alternative to Cloudflare to avoid possible double-caching issues, Jetpack’s Free version offers a few similar features such as an automatic static file CDN, and the Jetpack Professional subscription included with DreamPress Plus and Pro plans contains additional security features that can also offer an alternative to what Cloudflare provides.</p>
<p>Cloudflare offers additional beneficial features besides reverse proxy caching, and many DreamPress customers successfully run their site with Cloudflare active. These features include basic DDoS protection, captcha challenge by IP or Country Code, blocking specific IPs within the Cloudflare interface, comment spam and content scraping protection, and more.</p>
