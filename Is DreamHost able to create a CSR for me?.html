<p>DreamHost support is able to create a CSR for you using the current private key that you have in the control panel for your Secure Hosting configuration.</p>
<p>To contact support, navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Contact Support'</a>) page. When submitting the support request make sure to clearly state that you need a CSR created for your domain.</p>
<p>Support will need the following information to process your request:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Country Name (2 letter code):</li>
<li>State or Province Name (full name – no abbreviations!):</li>
<li>Locality Name (e.g., city):</li>
<li>Organization Name (e.g., company name):</li>
<li>Organizational Unit Name (e.g., company section name):</li>
<li>Common Name (e.g., SECURE DOMAIN NAME – <strong>do not include http://, https://, or www</strong> before the domain name. For example, just type: example.com):</li>
<li>Email Address:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Support will email you instructions on how to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">download the new CSR file</a>. You can then use this new CSR to order/renew a signed SSL certificate with another Certificate Authority.</p>
