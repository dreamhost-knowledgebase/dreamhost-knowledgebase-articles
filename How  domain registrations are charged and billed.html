<p>If a registration renewal price increases after you receive a renewal notice, DreamHost will honor the quoted rate in the notice. For example, if your quoted renewal is $9.99/year and the price then increases to $11.99/year, DreamHost will still bill you at $9.99/year.</p>

</div><h2><span id="autorenew_only">How 'Auto-Renew Only' domains are charged and billed</span></h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>What are 'Auto-Renew Only' domains?</h3>
<p>Certain country-code and specialty top-level domains (TLDs) do not renew the same way as a .COM or other generic TLDs. These are referred to as 'Auto-Renew Only' domains.</p>
<p>These domains are <a href="#auto_only_tlds">specific domains determined by the registry</a>. They do not have an "Add Years" button on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Registrations</a> page, and cannot be renewed by manually placing a renewal order.</p>
<h3><span id="auto_only_tlds">List of 'Auto-Renew Only' domains (TLDs) at DreamHost</span></h3>
<p>The following domains (TLDs) are 'Auto-Renew Only'. DreamHost strongly recommends that the auto-renew setting remain enabled on these domain names, unless the registrant chooses to discontinue renewing them:</p>
<ul>
<li>.AT</li>
<li>.DE</li>
<li>.IO</li>
<li>.JP</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the 31-day period between when it is charged, billed, and expires, you are not able to change the status of 'auto-renew' in the panel. This is a safeguard that ensures the domain does indeed renew, since you’ve already paid for the renewal. All of these details are reflected in the receipt that is emailed to you when the charge occurs.</p>
</div><h2><span id="domreg_renewal_refunds">Are domain registration renewals refundable?</span></h2><div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. Once a domain is auto-renewed, or it is manually renewed, your credit card is charged and the domain is renewed for 1 more year.</p>
<p>At this point the domain registry updates their information to show you are the owner for an additional year. Since there's no way to reverse the renewal from the registry, a refund is not possible.</p>
