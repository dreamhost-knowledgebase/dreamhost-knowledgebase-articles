<p>Promotional codes are offered at special times throughout the year to new customers. </p>
<h2><span id="How_do_promotional_codes_work.3F">How do promotional codes work?</span></h2>
<p>If you are a new customer, you can use a promotional code during <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">signup</a> to receive a discount on the initial service charge for your shared hosting plan. If you sign up using a promotional code that provides a discount off your first year of shared hosting fees, that hosting plan renews at the regular price the following year. This is because the promotional code discount is for the first year of service only. Make sure you're aware of exactly what the promo code offers when signing up.</p>
<p>Some promotional codes offer additional services, such as extra free registration credits. As long as you do not cancel or change the plan that the code was used towards, you still receive those extra services every year.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers promotional codes periodically throughout the year, such as during special events and sales promotions. </p>
<h2><span id="Rules_and_regulations_for_promotional_codes">Rules and regulations for promotional codes</span></h2>
<ol>
<li>Promotional codes can be used by new customers only.</li>
<li>If a domain was previously hosted in the system on another account, it cannot be hosted on a new account with a promotional code. If the domain must be moved to another account, the promo code must be revoked. This is to prevent abuse of the promotional code system. Once the new account is older than one year and the promotional period has ended, the restriction is lifted.</li>
<li>Promotional codes cannot be retroactively applied to accounts or changed to another promotional code after the initial sign-up process is completed.</li>
<li>Promotional code credits cannot be cashed out, refunded, or transferred to another account.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accounts that are found to be abusing the promo code system are subject to account suspension.</p>
