<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This article explains how to disable DreamHost spam filtering and update MX records on your domain.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Disabling the spam folder does not disable outbound filtering. If DreamHost's filtering system's algorithm detects potential spam from your email address, it will be returned to you as undeliverable. After reviewing the message, you may <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032561551-Reporting-false-positive-spam-email-in-MailChannels" target="_self">flag it as a false positive</a>.

<h2>Updating MX records</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>If your nameservers are pointed to DreamHost</h3>
<p>If your nameservers are pointed to DreamHost, you do not need to do anything. Your MX records will automatically update to the non-filtered records after deleting the Spam filter.</p>
<h3>If your nameservers are NOT pointed to DreamHost</h3>
<p>If your nameservers are NOT pointed to DreamHost, you must update your MX records to point to the new non-filtered MX records. If you do not, your email will not be delivered.</p>
<h3>Confirm where your nameservers are pointed</h3>
<p>View the following article to confirm where your nameservers are pointed.</p>
<ul class="article-list">
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030114711-Checking-where-your-Nameservers-are-pointed">Checking where your Nameservers are pointed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following are DreamHost's nameservers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you see anything else, you must update your MX records at the company where your nameservers are hosted.</p>
<h3>What MX records do I need to change? </h3>
<p>Update the following MX records at the company that hosts your nameservers. This ensures your email will continue to function.</p>
