<p>PTR records, also sometimes called reverse DNS lookup or rDNS, are needed for specific server types like email servers, and other host verification purposes.</p>
<p>It is possible to set up PTR records for IPv4 addresses in DreamCompute, however IPv6 rDNS is not available at this time.</p>
<p>Here is how you can configure PTR records.</p>
<div id="step-1-dreamhost-control-panel">
<h2>Step 1: DreamHost Control Panel</h2>
<p>The first step is to be completed by the customer, and happens in the DreamHost control panel.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Navigate to the <a class="reference external" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Manage Domains</a> page in your DreamHost panel.</li>
<li>If your domain is not yet listed here, click the “Add Hosting to a Domain / Sub-Domain” button near the top left of the page.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the “DNS Only” hosting section and enter your domain. Click the “Host DNS only!” button. Wait a few minutes for processing.</li>
<li>Back on the Manage Domains page, click the “DNS” link directly under your domain name.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure"><img src="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/article_attachments/214608807/DreamCompute-dns-panel.png" alt="../../_images/DreamCompute-dns-panel.png" /></div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the “Add a custom DNS record to YOURDOMAIN:” section, enter the A record for the domain or subdomain you wish to host and the PTR record to be based on. For example, if you want “mail.example.com” then “Name” will be “mail”, “Type” will be “A” and “Value” will be your public IPv4 address for your DreamCompute instance. Click “Add Record Now!”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeat the last step as many times as needed to add additional A records for domains you wish to host on your instance. If you add multiple records, the DreamHost system may not pick the one you wanted which requires the last step below. If you only enter one, chances are it will pick the right one and get set on its own after a few hours of DNS propagation time.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-2-contact-support">
<h2>Step 2: Contact Support</h2>
<p>Due to the possibly of multiple domains and multiple A records pointing to your public IPv4 address, DreamHost may not pick the one you want by default. To remedy this, please <a class="reference external" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;">contact support</a> and let us know the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Which domain or subdomain you want the PTR record to point to.</li>
<li>The public IPv4 address.</li>
</ul>
<p>DreamHost support will make sure that your public IPv4 address has the right record set and will push out a DNS update. After a wait of 4 or so hours for DNS propagation, your PTR record should show up!</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3-checking-ptr-records">
<h2>Step 3: Checking PTR Records</h2>
<p>Please allow at least 4 hours for DNS propagation, and after this you can check for the proper value. To do so from the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-console">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">[user@localhost]$</span> dig -x PUBLICIPADDRESSHERE
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are other websites that can help with this too, if you google for “PTR lookup”.</p>
