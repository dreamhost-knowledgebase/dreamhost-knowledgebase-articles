<h2>Additional tips and resources</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following are additional tips to further help you create a successful web guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write it in your own words and don't simply copy content from elsewhere. Your visitors like your unique voice, so use it to write your guide in a fun, engaging way.</li>
<li>Include an affiliate disclosure (see DreamHost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/refer-and-earn-terms-and-conditions/">Refer &amp; Earn Terms and Conditions</a>). You want to make sure that you cover your legal bases and spell out fine-print details for affiliates, so there are no surprises or disgruntled users.</li>
<li>Go the extra mile to help your audiences get started with DreamHost. Show them how easy it is to get set up with a hosting plan by including step-by-step sign-up screenshots and detailed walkthrough steps (see below). The more you can personalize your post, the more success you’ll have — not only for essential SEO purposes but for better engagement with your visitors and, ultimately, conversions.</li>
