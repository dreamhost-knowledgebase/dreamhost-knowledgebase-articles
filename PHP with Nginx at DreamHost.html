<p>For security purposes, it's generally advised to assign a single user to each domain. This way if that user is compromised, no other sites are affected. However, when running Nginx, it's recommended that you consolidate your domains under a single username. This is for performance reasons.</p>
<p>Nginx uses a set number of PHP processes when starting up. This happens for each user, and the same number are started regardless of how many domains are hosted under the user.</p>
<p>However, if you have 10 domains spread across 10 separate FTP users, you'll get 10x as many PHP processes as you would otherwise get with a single user.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that the number of PHP processes that spawn per user is automatically scaled with the amount of memory your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Virtual-Private-Server-overview-VPS-">VPS</a> is set to use.</p>
<h2><span id="Limiting_the_amount_of_processes_spawned_per_domain">Limiting the amount of processes spawned per domain</span></h2>
<p>Unlike Apache or Lighttpd, Nginx does not automatically spawn FCGI processes. You must start them separately. PHP5 auto-spawns as many as you set in the <strong>PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN</strong> environment variable.</p>
<p>View the following article for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/FcgiExample">http://wiki.nginx.org/FcgiExample</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN</strong> variable affects how many PHP pages can be processed simultaneously. The lower the value, the less memory used. But if you're getting a lot of traffic this slows down your response time. This value defaults to 9 on DreamHost Nginx servers.</p>

<li>Using an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215945467-How-do-I-add-users-to-a-Dedicated-server-">admin user</a>Â on a Dedicated server, navigate to the following directory:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">/dh/nginx/servers/httpd-ps12345/environ
</pre>
</div>
</li>
<li>Use the 'sudo' command to edit this file. You'll see the following lines:

<pre class="prebox">PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN=9
