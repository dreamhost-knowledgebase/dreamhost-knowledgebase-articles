<p>To access your MySQL database, you need a unique hostname (domain name) or IP address for your MySQL server. This hostname can be any name you wish, so long as you have registered it, but it is commonly a subdomain of your primary domain and is named "mysql.example.TLD".</p>
<p>For example, let’s say your domain is <strong>example.com</strong>: you can then create the subdomain "<strong>mysql</strong>.example.com" which is used to connect to your database server.</p>
<p>This arrangement is convenient to use with DreamHost's MySQL installations, as you can create and manage all of your databases from the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.mysql&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'MySQL Databases'</a>) page.</p>
<h2>What hostname should be used if DNS is not yet pointed to DreamHost?</h2>
<p>During a server or web host migration, the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> for "<strong>example.tld</strong>" may not point to DreamHost's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a>, so you won't be able to use "<strong>mysql</strong>.example.tld" for the MySQL hostname.</p>
<p>If you have other domains hosted at DreamHost, you can use their hostname instead. This is because your MySQL server (which hosts all of your databases) is accessible from <em><strong>any</strong></em> subdomain that you assign to it within your DreamHost account. </p>
<p>For example, if you have another domain like '<strong>dreamhostexample.com</strong>' and its nameservers are pointed to DreamHost, you could create a mysql hostname titled <strong>mysql</strong>.dreamhostexample.com. You can then use this hostname to connect to ANY database in your DreamHost account.</p>
<h2>What if I do not have any domains pointed to DreamHost?</h2>
<p>If you do not have any domains hosted at DreamHost, you can still connect to your database. To do this, you must add a free dreamhosters.com subdomain. It would appear like '<strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong>'. You can then create a mysql hostname such as '<strong>mysql</strong>.example.dreamhosters.com'. View the following article for instructions on how to create this subdomain.</p>
