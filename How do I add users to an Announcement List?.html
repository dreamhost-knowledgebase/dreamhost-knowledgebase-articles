<h2>Setting up an autoresponse welcome message for anyone who subscribes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Set up ListName@example.com to be a valid email alias (which can point to null if you don't want to receive an email notifying you each time a new person subscribes).</li>
<li>Configure an auto-responder for that alias.</li>
<li>Make sure you DO have the "emailit" hidden input in any form you're using for signups.</li>
</ol>

<p>This applies to the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203272168-Announcement-Lists">Announcement Lists</a>. <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203242197-Discussion-Lists">Discussion Lists</a> have their own configuration for sending a welcome message to all new subscribers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Viewing/editing user details</h2>
<p>Once a user accepts to become added to the list, you'll see them listed in the 'Edit Subscriber List' section next to the words 'Current Subscriber List':</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/07_Announcement_list.png" alt="07 Announcement list.png" width="799" height="245" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Three options appear on the left:</p>
<ul>
<li>show dates</li>
<li>shows names</li>
<li>show bounces</li>
</ul>
<p>In the screenshot above, all three are already selected which displays the user information to the right of their email address.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>As you can see in the above screenshot, the name does not appear. Unfortunately, there is no way to edit an existing user to change the name. If you require a different name, you must remove the user, and then add again as shown in the next section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>How can I assign a name to a user?</h2>
<p>When add the user to the 'Emails to Add' field for the first time, you can specify their name in this format:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">email@example.com John Doe
</pre>
</div>
<p>For example:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/08_Announcement_list.png" alt="08 Announcement list.png" width="546" height="135" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can only change the name when it's originally added. If you want to change it later, you must delete the address and then add it again with a new name.</p>
<h2>How many emails can be added to the list?</h2>
<p>There is no limit to the number of people you can add to a list. That is the reason why the list service should be used instead of sending a blast email to multiple contacts through your standard email address which has quota limits. SMTP limitations prevent this with your regular email address and other mail providers may have outgoing mail restrictions as well. So, the list service is ideal for sending a single email to a large amount of subscribers.</p>
<p>However, please note that it may take a while for all of the messages to go out if you have a very large list.</p>
<p>If a message sent for the list hasn’t been delivered and it’s been over a few hours, do <strong>not</strong> resend the message. <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">Contact support</a> so the mail logs can be checked.</p>
