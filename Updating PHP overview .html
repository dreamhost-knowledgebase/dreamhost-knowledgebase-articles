<p>This article explains how to check the code of your site and determine if it's compatible with the newer versions of PHP.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I know if my type of website is compatible with the latest PHP versions?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's important to keep your website updated so it can function with the latest updates to PHP. Log into the dashboard of your website to check the version. Then, visit the official website to confirm which versions of PHP are compatible with it.</p>
</div>
<h2>Custom site built by a developer</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The most common issue with custom sites is outdated code. For example, your site may be using deprecated functions that the newer version of PHP no longer supports. In this case, the site will continue to function, but you may see PHP warnings.</p>

</ul>
<p>If the function has been removed from the newer versions of PHP, your site may not function.&nbsp;You can search for the function at <a href="http://php.net/">php.net</a>. Its page will confirm which versions of PHP still support it.</p>
