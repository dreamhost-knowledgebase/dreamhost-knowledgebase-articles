<p>This article explains how to check the code of your site and determine if it's compatible with the newer versions of PHP.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I know if my type of website is compatible with the latest PHP versions?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's important to keep your website updated so it can function with the latest updates to PHP. To confirm if your site is compatible with the supported PHP versions in the panel, you must first confirm how your site was built. The following sections give you a few examples of how to determine this.</p>
</div>
<h2>One-Click Installs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost offers several types of One-Click installs you can use to quickly build your website. The following page lists current options available in the panel.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215089938-What-One-Click-Installs-does-DreamHost-offer-" target="_self">What One-Click Installs does DreamHost offer?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to keep your One-Click installs up to date. You can do this in the panel by using the steps described in the following article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215915977-How-to-upgrade-a-One-Click-Install" target="_self">How to upgrade a One-Click Install</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=domain.installer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One-Click Installs</a> page, you can view any previously installed on your sites:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/one-click-version-number.png" alt="one-click version number" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>This example shows a WordPress site running version 5.3.2. You can then check the software's official website to check which PHP versions are compatible with this version of the software. For example, the following links help you determine which versions will function with your installation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_self">WordPress Requirements</a>&nbsp;(You must also confirm that the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/" target="_self">theme</a> you're using and any <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_self">plugins</a> are also compatible with your PHP version.)</li>
<li><a href="https://documentation.concrete5.org/developers/introduction/system-requirements" target="_self">Concrete5</a></li>
<li><a href="https://downloads.joomla.org/us/technical-requirements-us" target="_self">Joomla!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Compatibility" target="_self">MediaWiki</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.phpbb.com/support/documents.php?mode=install&amp;version=3#require" target="_self">phpBB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.zen-cart.com/content.php?48-what-are-the-server-requirements-to-run-zen-cart&amp;" target="_self">Zen Cart</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Non One-Click Installs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You may have also manually installed a software program to run your site which is not a One-Click Install from the DreamHost panel. In this case, simply log into the dashboard of your website to check the version. Then, visit the official website to confirm which versions of PHP are compatible with it.</p>
</div>
<h2>Custom site built by a developer</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The most common issue with custom sites is outdated code. For example, your site may be using deprecated functions that the newer version of PHP no longer supports. In this case, the site will continue to function, but you may see PHP warnings.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214894197-Where-can-I-view-PHP-errors-and-warnings-" target="_self">Where can I view PHP errors and warnings?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the function has been removed from the newer versions of PHP, your site may not function.&nbsp;You can search for the function at <a href="http://php.net/">php.net</a>. Its page will confirm which versions of PHP still support it.</p>
