<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress websites are managed WordPress sites that are created with a unique user. This user is originally created as an SFTP user, however, in order to log into your DreamPress website, you must first change this user into a Shell user. This article walks you through this process.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h2>Step 1&nbsp;— Confirm your user is a Shell user</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress users are created as SSH users by default. You can use the following steps to confirm your current DreamPress user is set to a Shell user.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Users</a> page.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage-users-log-in-info-dropdown.png" alt="user credentials dropdown" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Under the 'DreamPress' header, look for the correct user and website. To the right, click the 'Show Info' dropdown.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dreampress-edit-access-settings.png" alt="toggle ssh" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>You should see the Protocol is already set to SSH. If not, click 'Edit Access Settings'.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/ssh-access.png" alt="user credentials dropdown" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the 'Protocol' dropdown and select SSH.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the change has been made, wait a few minutes for this change to take effect. You may then proceed with the next step.</p>
</div>
<h2>Step 2 — Logging into your server via SSH</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Now that your user is a Shell user, you can log into it via SSH.</p>
<h3>Opening up a terminal application</h3>
<p>A terminal is a program you use to type Shell commands. There are several terminal clients (applications) you can use on any operating system. View the following article for the easiest options for Windows, Mac, and Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215360828-SSH-client-software">SSH client software</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Logging in</h3>
<p>Once you have chosen a terminal, open it to view a blank screen. Here you can enter a command to log into your server.</p>
<p>To log in, type in 'ssh', followed by your Shell username, an @ sign, then your website. For example:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[local]$ </span><span class="command">ssh username@example.com</span></pre>
</div>
<p>You are then asked for your Shell user's password. Enter this and you'll be logged in.</p>
</div>
<h2>Resetting your password</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you have forgotten your user's password, you can reset it on the&nbsp;<a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Users</a> page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Users</a> page.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the 'Show Info' dropdown to the right of your username.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/manage-users-reset-password.png" alt="reset password" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Reset Password</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once changed, wait at least 5 minutes for it to update before logging in.</p>
