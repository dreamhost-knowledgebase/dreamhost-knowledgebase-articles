<p>This article explains how to make changes to a Discussion List.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HRTFNXGT60Y7Y7MBH8XS5XTX">Logging in</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.discussion&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussion Lists</a>&nbsp;page.</li>
<li>To the right of your list, click the <strong>Admin</strong> button.</li>
<li>Enter the admin password you used when you originally created the list.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Let me in..</strong> button.
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If youâ€™ve forgotten the password to log into your Discussion List panel, you must contact <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email" target="_self">DreamHost support via email</a>&nbsp;and request that it be reset for you.</p>
<p>For security purposes, the password can only be reset if you're writing in from the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001898171-Updating-your-contact-information" target="_self">primary email address linked to your account</a>.</p>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><em>The Discussion List admin page opens where you can configure the list as you wish.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HRTFNXGTHZ13EHPBZEVM1QKR">Discussion List archives</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Discussion List archives are controlled from the list's Administrator area. They are enabled by default, and can be set to <strong>private</strong> (accessible only to list subscribers) or <strong>public</strong> (anyone can see them).</p>
<p>The Discussion Lists and the archives are not stored on your web server, and are instead stored on a separate server dedicated to Discussion Lists. If you need anything removed from an archive, you must contact <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">DreamHost support</a>. There is no way to remove this information from within the admin panel.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HRTFNXGTM9JDBXR876DR135P">from_is_list setting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Mailman has a <span class="text-object">from_is_list</span> setting that can help address some bounced emails due to the DMARC policy implemented by other mail providers.</p>
<p>Your list may benefit from using this if some of your list members have mail service from domains or providers that use DMARC, domain-keys, or other ways of signing and authenticating email. When an email from those senders is sent back out from a Discussion List, those authentication methods may fail verification checks and can make the email appear to be fake or spoofed.</p>
<p>To enable this feature:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <span class="panel-page">General Options</span> page&nbsp;after logging in.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-08_panel_discussion_list_manage_04.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Make sure to select the 'Mung From' option.
<dl>
<dt><em>The default setting for this option is "No". The other two options are:</em></dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Mung From</strong></dt>
<dd>Rewrites (Mungs) the From: header, so the email is sent 'from' the sender's name with the email address of the Discussion List.</dd>
<dt><strong>Wrap Message</strong></dt>
<dd>Wraps the message, similar to forwarding an email. The email sent to the list is enclosed in a new email sent from the list and the list's email address is the sender.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> enable the 'Wrap Message' option as it currently does not function, and prevents delivery of your emails to the list. The 'Mung From' is the only option you should enable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HRTFNXGTP2TDF5QAWASE7F2E">Email addresses for list actions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each Discussion List has a set of email addresses automatically set up for it to send email to the list subscribers and perform other actions. The email addresses are not listed in the panel's <span class="panel-page">Manage Email</span> page, but they are created for every Discussion List automatically.</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>listname@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>Main email address for the Discussion List. Email sent to this address sends out to the list's subscribers.</dd>
<dt><strong>listname-admin@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>An alias for the <span class="text-object">listname-bounces@lists.example.com</span> address. This user is obsolete, but kept for backwards compatibility.</dd>
<dt><strong>listname-bounces@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>The <span class="text-object">listname-bounces@lists.example.com</span> address is the recipient for bounced messages on the mailing list and is generally listed as the sender for emails sent out from the Discussion List. Emails sent directly to <span class="text-object">listname-bounces@lists.example.com</span> are generally treated as an unrecognized bounce.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Bounced messages may be forwarded to <span class="text-object">listname-owner@lists.example.com</span> if you've set the corresponding options found under <span class="text-section">Bounce processing &gt; Notifications</span> in your Discussion List panel. Although these notifications may also come from <span class="text-object">mailman-bounces@lists.example.com</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>listname-confirm@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>The <span class="text-object">listname-confirm@lists.example.com</span> address is only used as the recipient for confirmation messages. Actions that may require confirmation include subscribe and unsubscribe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>listname-join@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>An alias for the <span class="text-object">listname-subscribe@lists.example.com</span> address.</dd>
<dt><strong>listname-leave@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>An alias for the <span class="text-object">listname-unsubscribe@lists.example.com</span> address.</dd>
<dt><strong>listname-owner@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>Email sent to <span class="text-object">listname-owner@lists.example.com</span> are sent to all addresses in both the "owner" and "moderator" fields. You can view these fields on the <span class="panel-page">General Options</span> page under the <span class="text-section">General list personality</span> section.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-08_panel_discussion_list_manage_06.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>listname-request@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>The <span class="text-object">listname-request@lists.example.com</span> address allows commands to be executed on the mailing list via email by sending the commands as the email body to the <span class="text-object">listname-request@lists.example.com</span> address. Send just the word 'help' in the body to receive all of the valid commands and their usage.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>listname-subscribe@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>Email sent to <span class="text-object">listname-subscribe@lists.example.com</span> triggers a subscribe action for the sender. Depending on your mailing list subscription policy, a subscribe request must be confirmed by the sender, approved by a list administrator/moderator, or both. You can view this setting on the <span class="text-section">Privacy options... &gt; [Subscription rules]</span> page.&nbsp;Under the <span class="text-section">Subscribing</span> section, you can see the 'subscribe_policy' option.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt><strong>listname-unsubscribe@lists.example.com</strong></dt>
<dd>Email sent to <span class="text-object">listname-unsubscribe@lists.example.com</span> triggers an unsubscribe action for the sender. Depending on your mailing list unsubscription policy, an unsubscribe request may need to be approved by a list administrator/moderator. You can view this setting on the <span class="text-section">Privacy options... &gt; [Subscription rules]</span> page. Under the <span class="text-section">Subscribing</span> section, you can see the 'unsubscribe_policy' option.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="h_01HRTFNXGTSNHE0WDNNP9N9XXG">Adding new users to the list</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>On the top left, click '<strong>Membership Management...</strong>'. Three more options drop down in a list.</li>
<li>Under 'Membership Management...', click '<strong>Mass Subscription</strong>'.</li>
<li>Add a list of email addresses (one per line), or upload a file with all email addresses listed.
