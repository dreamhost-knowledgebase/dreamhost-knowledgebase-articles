<p>The following FAQs describe common issues with the iPhone mail app and their potential solutions.</p>

<h2>I've added a DreamHost mail account to my iPhone, but it won't connect</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you set up an mail account, your iPhone automatically detects the rest of the settings and connects to your mailbox. If there are any issues, then make sure you've entered the correct settings for both the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385537-Set-up-email-on-an-iPhone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incoming and outgoing mail servers</a>.</p>
<p>If needed, you can also make the following changes in the <span class="text-section">Advanced</span> section if you are experiencing any sync issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must set the <strong>IMAP Path Prefix</strong> to <big><strong>INBOX</strong></big> (all caps) for IMAP clients to work properly with DreamHost servers. Most desktop email clients work normally but instead show all the folders <em>under</em> the Inbox as subfolders rather than alongside it.</li>
<li>For sent messages, tap <span class="text-object">Sent Mailbox</span> under the <span class="text-section">MAILBOX BEHAVIORS</span> section, and then tap the folder you wish to use for sent messages (in the <span class="text-section">ON THE SERVER</span> section). The current choice has a paper airplane next to it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The 'Cannot Verify Server Identity' message appears</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you enter any other hostname other than <strong>imap</strong>.dreamhost.com, the following message appears after you connect:</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>'<strong>Cannot Verify Server Identity.</strong> The identity of "mail.example.com" cannot be verified by Settings. Review the certificate details to continue.'</em></dd>
</dl>
<p>Review the steps above to ensure the hostname you've entered to connect is <strong>imap.dreamhost.com</strong>. This will resolve the error.</p>
</div>
<h2>Emails are bounced with a 'rejected by the server because it does not allow relaying' error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you see a 'relaying' error, double-check your outgoing connection settings and ensure that you're using <strong>smtp</strong>.dreamhost.com as your hostname, along with your username and password.</p>
</div>
<h2>How can I manually choose POP3 or IMAP on my iPhone?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Recent versions of the iOS mail client attempt to auto-detect whether the server supports POP3 or IMAP and select either accordingly. To make the choice manually, enter an incorrect email address into the 'Settings' page on your iPhone, e.g., [a bogus email address]@[your domain]. The settings will then not auto-detect, and you can select which protocol you wish to use. Don't forget to fix your email address to [your correct email address]@[your domain].</p>

<h2>iPhone password error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you continue to see password error-related messages on your iPhone, you can delete the account from your phone and re-add it. See the following <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252056513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Support page</a> for more information:</p>
