<p><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413677-Account-privileges-overview" target="_self">Account Privileges</a> allow you to grant account access to another person so they can edit settings within the panel. For example, you could allow someone to access&nbsp; the following settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to servers settings</li>
<li>Access to domain hosting plans</li>
<li>Access to domain registrations</li>
<li>Access to users</li>
</ul>
<p>Account privileges allow access to most sections of the panel, however, not all sections are available to all users.</p>
<h2>Sub-account access to Cloud Services</h2>
<p>It is currently not possible to assign Account privileges to DreamObjects or DreamCompute. This means that when you create a new sub-account, the user will see the following when they log into their account and attempt to access the <span class="text-section">Cloud Services</span> menu.</p>
