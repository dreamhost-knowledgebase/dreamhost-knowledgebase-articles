<h3 id="h_01HXZ4J8FYC8DA6GJBZN14HYY0">Downgrading to shared or VPS plan</h3>
<p>First, make sure you've added a shared or VPS hosting plan.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945617-Adding-a-VPS" target="_self" rel="undefined">Adding a VPS</a></li>

<p>You can then delete the Dedicated Server.</p>

</ul>
<p>When deleting, you will see a message informing you that everything on the Dedicated Server will be moved to the shared or VPS server.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you have both a shared and VPS server on your account, only the VPS server will show as an option to move to when deleting your Dedicated Server.</p>
<p>If you would prefer to move to a shared server, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">contact support</a>. DreamHost support will then move the data for you.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HXZ4J8FYSEARRTC1WDYJ727D">Moving to DreamPress</h3>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to move an existing WordPress site to DreamPress:</p>

<p>If you only had the single WordPress site on your Dedicated Server, you can then cancel it.</p>

<p>If you have other sites on the Dedicated Server, you must continue paying for that plan since only the single site would have been moved to DreamPress.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HXZ4J8FY6TZ3JBE98P67VA0W">Moving to a different Dedicated Hosting plan</h3>
