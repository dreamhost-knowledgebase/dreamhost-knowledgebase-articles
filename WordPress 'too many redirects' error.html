</dl>

<h2>Causes of the error</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This error is usually caused because the HOME and SITE URL within WordPress is not configured correctly. For example, if your site is&nbsp;<strong>example.com</strong>, the Home and Site URL in your database should point to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://example.com</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Home and Site URL add 'www' to the URL, it may appear like this in your database:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://www.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will cause your site to redirect in a loop.</p>
<h3>Other causes</h3>
<p>There are a few other reasons your site could redirect.</p>
<h4>Plugins</h4>
<p>It's possible that a plugin you added to your site has caused the redirect. Try <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300817#Disabling_plugins">disabling your plugins</a> to confirm if that is the cause.</p>
<h4>.htaccess file</h4>
<p>Your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456227--htaccess-overview">.htaccess file</a> may have a redirect set up somewhere. Open the <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file and view its contents. Look for anything redirecting your site to a different URL.</p>
<h4>Cloudflare configuration</h4>
<p>If you have added an SSL certificate to your website and are also using Cloudflare, you must configure some settings at Cloudflare. There is a setting in your Cloudflare panel to set your SSL certificate to use a specific type. This should be set to 'Full (strict)'. View the following article for full instructions:</p>
