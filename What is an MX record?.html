<p>Mail Exchange (MX) records are DNS records that are necessary for delivering email to your address.</p>
<p>In simple DNS terms, an MX record is used to tell the world which machines accept incoming mail for your domain and where emails sent to your domain should be routed to. Most DreamHost customers host their mail service at DreamHost and all the required mail-related DNS records are created automatically after adding addresses to your domain in your panel.</p>
<p>You can also switch a domain's mail service between DreamHost, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215747558-How-do-I-use-Google-Apps-on-my-domain-">Gmail / Google Apps</a>, or somewhere else entirely.</p>

<p>Changing your MX records only points where email is routed. Your old email is not migrated to the new email host. View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215730637-How-do-I-backup-my-email-">Transferring Emails</a> article for instructions on how to back up your old emails first.</p>

<h2><span id="Example_of_an_MX_record">Example of an MX record</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>MX records consist of two parts: the priority and the domain name. For example:</li>
</ul>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">0 mail.EXAMPLE.com</pre>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The ‘0’ is the priority.</li>
<li>The lower the number means a higher priority.</li>
<li>The ‘mail.EXAMPLE.com’ is the mail server to which it connects.</li>
<li>Outgoing email servers connect to the MX servers in order of priority.</li>
<li>If two servers have the same priority, it picks one at random. (This in effect load balances the connections.)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Who_controls_my_MX_records.3F">Who controls my MX records?</span></h2>
<p>Your MX records are controlled at the company where your <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">Nameservers</a> are pointed. If your domain is using DreamHost's nameservers (you can check this at <a href="http://whoisweb.dreamhost.com" rel="nofollow">http://whoisweb.dreamhost.com</a>), then all <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> changes (including custom MX records) are made in your DreamHost panel.</p>
<p>If your domain is not using DreamHost's nameservers, all DNS changes (including custom MX records) must be done at the company that hosts your nameservers. If you want to use regular DreamHost-hosted mail service with a domain using non-DreamHost nameservers, you can set up custom mail DNS records at your outside DNS provider using the mail DNS information from your DreamHost panel. See the following article for details on how to find these records.</p>
