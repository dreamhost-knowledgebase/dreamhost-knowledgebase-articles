<p>Follow each step in order to prevent any data loss when migrating a Discussion List:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the new account has no issue adding the domain to their panel. This means the new account cannot be using an active promo code or have a listed referrer. If you're unsure about this, <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">contact support</a>. You can do this on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.msg&amp;">Panel &gt; ‘Support’ &gt; ‘Contact Support’</a>) page.
