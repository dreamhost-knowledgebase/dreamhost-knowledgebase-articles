<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>At DreamHost you can purchase a domain registration without having to purchase an account. You also have the option of adding a domain registration to an existing account. This article explains how to add a registration both ways.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>You must resolve any outstanding account balance before you can purchase, renew, or transfer-in a domain registration.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also view a list of available domains and their pricing at the following page:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Purchasing a domain registration only</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>The following instructions explain how to add the registration without a hosting plan. A hosting plan is only needed if you wish to set up a live website at DreamHost. View the following article for a list of hosting plans available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">Types of hosting plans at DreamHost</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you only wish to own a registration and not set up a website at DreamHost, proceed with the following steps.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>You can purchase a domain registration from DreamHost on the following page:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/domains/"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">https://www.dreamhost.com/domains/</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On this page you can search for the domain you wish to purchase.</li>
<li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>'Buy now'</strong> button when you're ready to purchase.</li>
<li>This opens the signup.dreamhost.com page where you can create your FREE registration only account.

</dl>
</li>
<li>Choose how many years you would like to purchase the registration for and click the <strong>'Register Now'</strong> button.</li>
<li>On the final page, enter your personal information which is used to assign the domain ownership to you.</li>
<li>At the bottom, enter your credit card information and click <strong>Place order now</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once purchased, you'll have access to your panel. In this panel you can update the domain's DNS settings.</p>
<p>In this way you can purchase the registration at DreamHost, but point the DNS to another hosting company to host the site there. You can also choose to leave it in your DreamHost account for future use.</p>
</div>
<h2>Adding a registration to an existing account</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>DreamHost allows you to register multiple domain names such as example.net, example.store, and example.club in a single sign up process through the panel.</p>

<h2>Controlling DNS for the registration</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After logging into your panel, you can see the domain registration is set to DNS Only. This means you have control over where the DNS records are pointed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, they are set to DreamHost. If you wish to point them to another hosting company you can either create custom DNS records or update the nameservers. View the following articles for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035516812-Adding-custom-DNS-records">Adding custom DNS records</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038897151-Changing-your-nameservers-at-DreamHost" target="_self" rel="undefined">Updating nameservers</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>How long until the domain is available online?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>As mentioned above, once registered, your domain's nameservers are set to DreamHost. These can take 24-72 hrs to fully propagate online.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS propagation overview</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you add the domain to a web server to be hosted, those records can take around 6 hrs to update.</p>
<p>To minimize the time for the site to resolve online, it's recommended that you add hosting in your panel right away.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>That way, when the nameservers have updated, your site will automatically resolve.</p>
</div>
<h2>Deleting a registration you just purchased</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It’s possible to delete a domain registration within 5 days of purchase. This is often necessary if it was misspelled. However this time period is not available for certain TLDs. Depending on the TLD you purchased, it’s possible there is no grace period at all. <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215722447-Contacting-DreamHost-via-email">Contact support</a> immediately if you wish to reverse your recent purchase.</p>
