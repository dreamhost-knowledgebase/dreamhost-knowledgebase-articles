<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you did not select the option to move your sites and users to the VPS when ordering, you can still move them at a later time.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Ensure your new VPS has enough room to migrate your user's content. When you purchase a new VPS, it can store from 30GB - 240GB. Check your <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.disk&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk Usage</a> page to confirm your users will fit on the new server.</p>
<p>This page can be accessed from the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=billing.account" target="_self">Manage Account</a> page.</p>

<h2>Migrating your sites and users</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>When you add a second VPS, you wonâ€™t be able to automatically move data from an existing VPS to the new VPS. However, you can migrate your users and domains using these instructions after provisioning the VPS.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=vps.dashboard&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VPS</a> page.</li>
<li>Above the Add VPS button, click the link titled <span class="text-link">Click here</span> to move all users and domains.</li>
<li>Select the desired VPS from the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Move all shared users and domains</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your users and domains are then migrated over to your chosen VPS.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Ensure the VPS has enough space to migrate all your users and domains. If there is insufficient space on the VPS, the migration fails, and you may be unable to log in.</p>
<p>You can confirm the space you need on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=users.dashboard#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SFTP Users &amp; Files</a> page. View the value under the <span class="text-object">Usage</span> column next to your username.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You can only move <em>all</em> users (and their domains) or none. You cannot move a single user at a time to a VPS.</p>
</div>
<p>To move a single domain at a time from a shared server to a VPS, see the following article:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>What happens to email?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Moving a website user and domain to a new server does not affect email. This is because email is on a completely different mail server. Your email will continue to function normally.</p>
