<p>DNS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><strong>Domain Name System</strong></a>, provides various records that are looked up and used to make the Internet work. More specifically, it's a system that translates your domain name into an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217294917-IP-Address">IP address</a>. Your site will have a variety of DNS records for the multiple services it uses. The details in this article provide information regarding some of the records that are applied to your domain at DreamHost.</p>

<p>You can review all of the DNS records that are set up for any site you host at DreamHost on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) page. Under the domain name, click on the 'DNS' link:</p>

<p>The details for each column consist of the DNS record set up for your domain:</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<li>For example, if you have a record for the ‘www’ service, the ‘www’ name will be listed under this column.</li>
</ul>

<td style="width: 25%;">
<ul>
<li>Shows the record type.</li>
<li>For the ‘www’ hosting service, you will see ‘A’ here as it would be set up as an ‘A’ record for that service.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">
<ul>
<li>Shows the value for that record. You will see a different value here depending on the type of record that’s set up</li>
<li>For the ‘www’ record, this column will show an IP address to point the ‘www’ record to so that it’s hosted with DreamHost.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is very handy if your domain points to non-DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> and you need to configure any or all of these records manually to point to DreamHost services.</p>
<p>If you are using DreamHost hosting services (including parking or a redirect of the site), and your domain is registered with DreamHost, you should use these name servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the nameservers are pointing to DreamHost, the records on your domain’s DNS page will be applied to your domain.</p>
<h2>Using a domain managed by a third-party registrar</h2>
<p>If you want to use domain name that is registered at a third party registrar, you need to update your DNS records to point to DreamHost. You must update the DNS records at your third party registrar (the place where you purchased the domain registration).</p>
<p>Once updated, you can use the domain with any DreamHost hosting services. Visit the following article for instructions on how to do this at your specific registrar:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>At your third party registrar, update your nameservers to the DreamHost namservers shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40" style="color: #aaa;">64.90.62.230</span></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40" style="color: #aaa;">208.97.182.10</span></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40" style="color: #aaa;">66.33.205.230</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>When updating your nameservers at your registrar, you should only have to add the nameserver URL, not the IP. The IPs are listed above just in case your registrar asks for them.</p>
<p>This modification takes about 3–72 hours to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> across the Internet, after which your new nameservers will direct visitors to your account with DreamHost.</p>

<h2><span id="Customizing_DNS_records">Customizing DNS records</span></h2>
<p>Additionally, you can have your domain’s nameservers pointing to DreamHost, but point your domain’s A records to another web host so that the site is being hosted elsewhere. You can also create custom DNS entries on the ‘DNS’ page for your domain.</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Non-editable_DNS_records">Non-editable DNS records</span></h2>
<p>You’ll notice that there are numerous non-editable DNS records on your domain’s DNS page.</p>

<p>If you need to modify the A record, "www", or "ftp" records for your domain, you will need to remove the web hosting from that domain. This is done by setting the domain to 'DNS Only'. View the following article for instructions on how to do this:</p>
<ul>

<p>If you do not remove your hosting when adding your custom A records, a DNS conflict will occur as the domain will then point to two locations and will not respond properly.</p>

<ul>
<li>When you remove the web hosting, it will take some time before the change is reflected in the DNS records.</li>
<li>You can force the refresh on your domain's edit page, but you can do so once every 12 hours.</li>
<li>A typical DNS change will take up to 6 hours to resolve. Changes to the nameservers, however, will take longer. This will often resolve within 3 to 72 hours.</li>
