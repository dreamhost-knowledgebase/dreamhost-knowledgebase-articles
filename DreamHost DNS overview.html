<h2><span id="overview">Overview</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DNS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><strong>Domain Name System</strong></a>, is a directory of names and numbers that are looked up and used to identify where a website and its services are hosted. For example, your website has a specific name, but DNS translates this into a number. When you visit your site in a browser, DNS uses this number value to point to the correct server where you website is hosted.</p>
<p>Your site has a variety of DNS records for the multiple services it uses. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>website IP addresses</li>
<li>mail records</li>
<li>mysql records</li>
<li>ftp records</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="where-are-my-dns-records-controlled">Where are my DNS records controlled?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>All of your site's DNS records are controlled at the company where your site's Nameservers are pointed. This is a combination of two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company you registered your domain at (the Registrar)</li>
<li>The company your Nameservers are pointing to (the hosting company)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="registrar">The Registrar</span></h3>
<p>The domain registration is the name of your site. The company you purchased this from is the Registrar. If you want to change your Nameservers, or any other of your site's DNS records, you must log into your account at this company to make changes.</p>
<h3>The hosting company</h3>
<p>The Registrar of your website controls your site's Nameservers. The company where the Nameservers are pointed to controls ALL of your site's DNS records.</p>
<p>In this way, you can have the domain registered at one company, but host its DNS at another company.</p>
