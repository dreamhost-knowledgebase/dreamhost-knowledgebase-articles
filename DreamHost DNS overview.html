<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DNS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><strong>Domain Name System</strong></a>, provides various records that are looked up and used to make the Internet work. More specifically, it's a system that translates your domain name into an <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217294917-IP-Address">IP address</a>. Your site will have a variety of DNS records for the multiple services it uses. The details in this article provide information regarding some of the records that are applied to your domain at DreamHost.</p>

<p>You can review all of the DNS records that are set up for any site you host at DreamHost on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> page. Under the domain name, click on the 'DNS' link:</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_domains_dns_records_01.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The details for each column consist of the DNS record set up for your domain:</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<th bgcolor="#F2F2F2">Value</th>

<td style="width: 25%;">
<ul>
<li>Shows the service for this record.</li>
<li>For example, if you have a record for the ‘www’ service, the ‘www’ name will be listed under this column.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">
<ul>
<li>Shows the record type.</li>
<li>For the ‘www’ hosting service, you will see ‘A’ here as it would be set up as an ‘A’ record for that service.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td style="width: 25%;">
<ul>
<li>Shows the value for that record. You will see a different value here depending on the type of record that’s set up</li>
<li>For the ‘www’ record, this column will show an IP address to point the ‘www’ record to so that it’s hosted with DreamHost.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<p>This information is very handy if your domain points to non-DreamHost <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> and you need to configure any or all of these records manually to point to DreamHost services.</p>
<p>If you are using DreamHost hosting services (including parking or a redirect of the site), and your domain is registered with DreamHost, you should use these name servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As long as the nameservers are pointing to DreamHost, the records on your domain’s DNS page will be applied to your domain.</p>

<h2>Using a domain managed by a third-party registrar</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can still host your domain at DreamHost if it's registered at a different company. However, you will need to point your DNS to DreamHost in order for it to function. View the following article for information on how to adjust your DNS to point to DreamHost.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can have your domain’s nameservers pointing to DreamHost, but point your domain’s A records to another web host so that the site is being hosted elsewhere. You can also create custom DNS entries on the ‘DNS’ page for your domain.</p>
