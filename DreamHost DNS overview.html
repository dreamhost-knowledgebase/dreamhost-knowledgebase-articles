<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DNS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><strong>Domain Name System</strong></a>, is a directory of names and numbers that are looked up and used to identify where a website and its services are hosted. For example, your website has a specific name, but DNS translates this into a number. When you visit your site in a browser, DNS uses this number value to point to the correct server where you website is hosted.</p>
<p>Your site has a variety of DNS records for the multiple services it uses. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>website IP addresses</li>
<li>mail records</li>
<li>mysql records</li>
<li>ftp records</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section-link" id="where-are-my-dns-records-controlled"> </div>
<h2>Where are my DNS records controlled?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>All of your site's DNS records are controlled at the company where your site's Nameservers are pointed. This is a combination of two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>The company you registered your domain at (the Registrar)</li>
<li>The company your Nameservers are pointing to (the hosting company)</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="registrar">The Registrar</span></h3>
<p>The domain registration is the name of your site. The company you purchased this from is the Registrar. If you want to change your Nameservers or any other of your site's DNS records, you must log into your account at this company to make changes.</p>
<h3>The hosting company</h3>
<p>The Registrar of your website controls your site's Nameservers. The company where the Nameservers are pointed to controls ALL of your site's DNS records.</p>
<p>In this way, you can have the domain registered at one company, but host its DNS at another company.</p>

<h2>Using a domain managed by a third-party registrar</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can still host your domain at DreamHost if it's registered at a different company. However, you will need to point your DNS to DreamHost in order for it to function. View the following article for information on how to adjust your DNS to point to DreamHost after setting up your domain in the panel.</p>

<h2>Customizing DNS records</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can have your domain’s Nameservers pointing to DreamHost, but point your domain’s A records to another web host so that the site is being hosted elsewhere. You can also create custom DNS entries on the ‘DNS’ page for your domain. View the following article for more information on creating Custom DNS records.</p>
