<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A Discussion List is a useful service that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to create group conversations or discussions via email. When you send an email to the Discussion List, it automatically sends that email out to each of the list's subscribers.</li>
<li>The ability for your visitors from across the world to communicate with each other about topics of mutual interest.</li>
<li>A simple way to communicate beyond the confines of the site itself, and also provides you with another way to keep people interested in what you have to say and offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, a Discussion List is a common email address that is shared with list subscribers.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The following information pertains to email accounts hosted at DreamHost. If you use Google for email, you DO NOT have access to all of these features. For example, convenience addresses do NOT work if your email is hosted with Google or any other 3rd party mail provider.</p>

<h3>Mailman version</h3>
