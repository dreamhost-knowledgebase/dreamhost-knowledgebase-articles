<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>As of December 2019, PHP 5.6, 7.0, and 7.1 have been removed from the DreamHost panel. Any sites <strong>on a Shared server</strong> running PHP 5.6 or 7.0 are in the process of being upgraded to PHP 7.2. Websites on VPS and Dedicated servers will continue to run older versions of PHP for the time being.</p>
<p>If you would like to manually change the PHP version of your site, the current options are 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4. For more information, see the following article:</p>
