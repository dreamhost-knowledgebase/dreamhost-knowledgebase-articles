<h2>What if my site was previously using PHP 5.6, 7.0, or 7.1?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Any site <strong>on a shared server</strong> previously running PHP 5.6, 7.0, or 7.1 was automatically upgraded to PHP 7.2.</p>
<p>It's highly recommended that you upgrade your sites to PHP 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, or 8.1 as older versions will soon be removed completely from all DreamHost servers.</p>
