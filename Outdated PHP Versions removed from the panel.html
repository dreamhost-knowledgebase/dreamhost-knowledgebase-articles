<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>As of December 2019, PHP 5.6, 7.0, and 7.1 have been removed from the DreamHost panel and any sites using PHP 5.6 or 7.0 have been upgraded to PHP 7.2. If you would like to change the PHP version of your site, the current options are 7.2, 7.3, or 7.4.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What if my site was previously using PHP 7.0?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Any sites previously set to PHP 7.0 will continue to run them normally. However, it's highly recommended that you upgrade to PHP 7.2 or 7.3 as older versions will soon be removed completely from all DreamHost servers.</p>
