<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can purchase a domain registration at any company you like, however it's recommended that you purchase it at DreamHost:</p>

</ul>
<p>This makes it easy to control your hosting and registration at the same location (the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">DreamHost panel</a>). You can also purchase the registration at another company, but still host your site at DreamHost. This article explains how to go about this.</p>

<h2>Adding a hosting plan</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>In order for your site to display online, it must be set up on a hosting plan. This puts it on a web server so anyone in the world can view it. View the following articles for information on how to add a hosting plan and add your site to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215560437-What-types-of-hosting-plans-are-available-">What types of hosting plans are available?</a></li>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Add your site to your hosting plan</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Now that your hosting plan has been added, it's time to add your site to the plan. This adds the website to the DreamHost webserver so it can be seen on the Internet. View the following article for information on how to add a domain to your hosting plan.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>This only tells the server to serve this domain name. You must still point your DNS to the server so it displays online.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Pointing your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you originally purchased your domain registration at another company, the DNS settings were most likely set to that specific company. In order for your site to be hosted on DreamHost's servers, you must change the DNS settings for your registration to point to DreamHost.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3>Where is your site registered?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can run a WHOIS query to determine where your site is registered.&nbsp;View the following article for further information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215842648-How-to-run-a-WHOIS-query" target="_self">How to run a WHOIS query</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Where do I update my DNS records?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You must update the DNS records at your third party registrar (the place where you purchased the domain registration). You have two options to point your DNS to DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pointing Nameservers (recommended)</li>
<li>Pointing A records</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pointing Nameservers</strong></h4>
<p>Visit the following article for instructions on how to do this at your specific registrar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-How-do-I-change-my-nameservers-at-my-current-host-">How do I change my nameservers at my current host?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At your third party registrar, update your nameservers to the DreamHost nameservers shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">64.90.62.230</span></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">208.97.182.10</span></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">66.33.205.230</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>When updating your nameservers at your registrar, you should only have to add the nameserver URL, not the IP. The IPs are listed above just in case your registrar asks for them.</p>
<p>This modification takes about 3â€“72 hours to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> across the Internet, after which your new nameservers will direct visitors to your account with DreamHost.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h4><strong>Pointing A records</strong></h4>
<p>If you only want to host the website with DreamHost and not email or any other service, you can just point the A records. View the following article for instructions on how to find your site's IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378#What_A_records_do_I_point_my_site_to.3F" target="_self">What A records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Waiting for the DNS to update</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you change your DNS settings, you must wait until they update online.</p>
<p>If you changed your nameservers, this could take 24-72 hrs to fully update.</p>
<p>If you changed your A record, this should only take 4-6 hrs.</p>
