<h2>Adding a hosting plan</h2>

<h2>Pointing your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<p>When you originally purchased your domain registration at another company, the DNS settings were most likely set to that specific company. In order for your site to be hosted on DreamHost's servers, you must change the DNS settings for your registration to point to DreamHost.</p>
<p>View the following article for instructions on how to point your registration's DNS settings to your DreamHost server:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Waiting for the DNS to update</h2>
<p>After you change your DNS settings, you must wait until they update online.</p>
<p>If you changed your nameservers, this could take 24-72 hrs to fully update.</p>
<p>If you changed your A record, this should only take 4-6 hrs.</p>
