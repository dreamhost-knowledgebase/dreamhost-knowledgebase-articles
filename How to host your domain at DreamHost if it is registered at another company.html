<h3>What are the advantages of managing my domain registration at DreamHost?</h3>
<p>You can purchase a domain registration at any company you like, however, it's recommended that you purchase it at or transfer it to DreamHost. This makes it easy to control your hosting and registration at the same location (through the <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">DreamHost panel</a>). View the following articles for further information on purchasing or transferring domain registration:</p>

<h2><span id="Point_your_DNS">Pointing your DNS to DreamHost</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When you originally purchased your domain registration at another company, the DNS settings were most likely set to that specific company. In order for your site to be hosted on DreamHost's servers, you must change the DNS settings for your registration to point to DreamHost.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<h3>Where is your site registered?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can run a WHOIS query to determine where your site is registered.&nbsp;View the following article for further information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215842648-How-to-run-a-WHOIS-query" target="_self">How to run a WHOIS query</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Where do I update my DNS records?</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You must update the DNS records at your third party registrar (the place where you purchased the domain registration). You have two options to point your DNS to DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pointing Nameservers (recommended)</li>
<li>Pointing A records</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Pointing Nameservers</strong></h4>
<p>Visit the following article for instructions on how to do this at your specific registrar:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-Change-nameservers-at-your-current-host">Change nameservers at your current host</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At your third party registrar, update your nameservers to the DreamHost nameservers shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ns1.dreamhost.com</strong>&nbsp;<span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">162.159.26.24</span></li>
<li><strong>ns2.dreamhost.com</strong>&nbsp;<span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">162.159.27.142</span></li>
<li><strong>ns3.dreamhost.com</strong> <span class="wysiwyg-color-black40">162.159.27.84</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>When updating your nameservers at your registrar, you should only have to add the nameserver URL, not the IP. The IPs are listed above just in case your registrar asks for them.</p>
<p>This modification takes about 3–72 hours to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> across the Internet, after which your new nameservers will direct visitors to your account with DreamHost.</p>
<p>You can track the progress of your DNS update using either of the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatsmydns.net</a> — A popular site that checks DNS records around the world.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360055964552-Viewing-your-DreamHost-DNS-records" target="_self">Viewing your DreamHost DNS records</a> — Use DreamHost's DNS propagation checker in the panel.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><strong>Pointing A records</strong></h4>
<p>If you only want to host the website with DreamHost and not email or any other service, you can just point the A records. View the following article for instructions on how to find your site's IP address.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378#What_A_records_do_I_point_my_site_to.3F" target="_self">What A records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Waiting for the DNS to update</h3>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you change your DNS settings, you must wait until they update online.</p>
<p>If you changed your nameservers, this could take 24-72 hrs to fully update.</p>
<p>If you changed your A record, this should only take 4-6 hrs.</p>
