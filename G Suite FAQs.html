<h2>Do I need a DreamHost hosting plan for G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No, you do not need a hosting plan in order to have G Suite, but you do need a domain name to associate with your G Suite license. During G Suite signup, DreamHost asks you to select from a list of the domains in your DreamHost account.</p>

<h2>Can I migrate my existing email to G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, G Suite has a built-in data migration to import your team’s email, contacts, and calendars. View the following article for further details:</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a large number of users, Google recommends using their data migration service to migrate your users’ mail, contacts, and calendars to G Suite. The setup is simple, and most mail server connections can be made automatically. This feature is available under </span><strong>Data migration</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the G Suite admin console. Learn more about </span><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6003169"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G Suite’s migration utility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, best suited for large organizations.</span></p>
</div>
<h2>What do my MX settings need to be for G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If DreamHost is managing your DNS (you are using DreamHost's nameservers), this will be configured automatically.</p>
<p>If you are using a third party to manage your DNS (meaning you are not using DreamHost's nameservers), you will need to configure that with your DNS provider.</p>

<h2>Can I use a Discussion List if I'm using G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes.&nbsp;<span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;You don't have to use our email service to use our discussion lists, because the convenience addresses for the lists exist @lists.domain.com\n\nWe set up an A record for \&quot;lists.domain.com\&quot; that points to our discussion list machines, and there's some DNS hierarchy stuff where if an MX record doesn't exist but an A record does, it'll fallback on the A record to decide where the email delivery goes.\n\nThe list's email routes through the list machines and not our regular MX machines via those A records, so the MX for \&quot;domain.com\&quot; don't come into play (since the addresses live at lists.domain.com)&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:13057,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:10}">You don't have to use DreamHost's email service to use a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001263566-What-is-a-Discussion-List-" target="_self">Discussion List</a>. This is because the Discussion list is created on a subdomain such as @lists.example.com. This means the email is originating from DreamHost and not your G Suite account.<br /></span></p>
</div>
<h2 id="comparisons" class="header-section">Comparisons</h2>
<h2>How is G Suite different from a normal @gmail.com address?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>An address ending in @gmail.com is a free personal email address that has no connection to your website. When you have an @gmail.com address you also have access to Google Drive which comes with apps such as Storage, Online Document Editing, and Video meetings, but these are applications that are related only to your personal Google account. These have no relation to your website.</p>
<p>G Suite is configured for your domain name. This means it will end with something like @example.com. It comes with all the basic apps that a personal Google account does in addition to several other tools you can use to manage your website. You can create several email addresses on your domain (admin@example.com, contact@example.com,&nbsp;hello@example.com, etc..)&nbsp;&nbsp;within this account since it's an account for the domain. It also comes with an administrative console to make managing your website data very simple.</p>
</div>
<h2>How is G Suite different from DreamHost email?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>G Suite email addresses and DreamHost email addresses are both set up on your domain. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>admin@example.com</li>
<li>contact@example.com</li>
<li>user@example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is that G Suite comes with several apps from Google to manage your website data. These include email, online document editing, video chats, and more. DreamHost email does not offer these Google services.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="header-section">Payment</h2>
<h2>Why would I want to pay for G Suite when Google offers similar products for free?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">

<h2 class="header-section">Domain registration</h2>
<h2>Is a domain registration included in the price of G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The cost of a domain is separate from the price of G Suite.&nbsp;Domain registration fees can vary widely depending on the extension (.com, .net, .org, etc.) and you may prefer to add G Suite to a domain you already own.</p>
<p>During G Suite signup at DreamHost, you can specify the domain you would like associated to your G Suite account. View the following article for further details:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215767937-Domain-registration-overview" target="_self">Domain registration overview</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Will email still work if my domain registration expires?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email service will only work with a valid domain registration and up-to-date </span><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MX records</span></a>.<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;DreamHost verifies this for you during G Suite setup. Email messages sent to an address at an expired domain would bounce back to the sender with a notification that the message was undelivered.</span></p>
</div>
<h2 class="header-section">Plans</h2>
<h2>What are the differences between G Suite Basic and G Suite Business edition?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost offers two editions of G Suite:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic</li>
<li>Business.</li>
</ul>
<p>G Suite Business includes all the features of Basic, plus more storage, enhanced search, and archiving. View the following article for further details.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Can I combine 'Basic' and 'Business' edition users under one domain on G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">G Suite uses a site-license, where all users within a domain must be of the same type — either all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">G Suite Basic</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or all </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">G Suite Business</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When you add users, they are automatically created as your current license type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With G Suite’s flexible monthly billing, you may upgrade/downgrade your domain’s G Suite plan at any time, and your bill will be adjusted accordingly. There are no fees for modifying your G Suite subscription, aside from the cost of the plan itself. </span></p>

<h2 class="header-section">Add-ons</h2>
<h2>Can I purchase individual G Suite apps?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>No. When you sign up for G Suite, you’ll gain access to a set of integrated apps (excluding Google Voice)&nbsp; that work together seamlessly. For instance, you can receive a message in Gmail and instantly convert it into a Calendar event. When you make a comment in Docs, Sheets, or Slides, collaborators automatically receive email alerts. With a single click, you can launch a Hangouts video meeting from your inbox or calendar.</p>
<p>Using these tools together improves productivity and gives your business the most value. However, you are welcome to purchase the suite and only use the services of your choice.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can I add G Suite users later?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. You may add or remove users to your G Suite account any time.&nbsp;G Suite from DreamHost uses flexible monthly billing, where your bill automatically adjusts to the user count selected in your DreamHost panel.</span></p>
<p>During the initial setup, you will set up your first user, who is also your Admin User.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">To add more users, simply log in to your G Suite admin homepage, where you’ll find a link to add individual users or upload a .CSV file to bulk-assign new users.</span></p>
</div>
<h2>Is Google Voice available with G Suite?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Google Voice is not available if you purchased your G Suite subscription through DreamHost. If you require Google Voice, you must purchase a G Suite subscription directly through Google.</p>
</div>
