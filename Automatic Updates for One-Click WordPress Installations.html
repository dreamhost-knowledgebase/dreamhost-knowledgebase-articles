<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Staying on top of both plugins and core WordPress upgrades is the single best thing you can do to keep your site current and safe: not only will it keep your site less prone to hack attempts, but almost every new version of the software has tweaks that offer speed increases.</p>
<p>All One-Click WordPress installations at DreamHost have automatic updates enabled by default. This option can be deactivated after WordPress is installed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Automatic update features</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost automatic updates include the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost performs an upgrade to your WordPress site 1–3 weeks following a major version release. If you wish to manually upgrade before then, you can do so by following <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037291651-Manually-updating-WordPress" target="_self">these steps</a>.</li>
<li>DreamHost also upgrades any available plugins that allow automatic upgrades during the process.</li>
<li>Once an upgrade completes, you are notified via email.</li>
<li>If any errors are found during the upgrade process, DreamHost will reverse the upgrade and notify you via email. DreamHost's automatic updates are only available for sites with an active One-Click Installation of WordPress. <em>If automatic updates are disabled, they cannot be enabled again in the future</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Disabling automatic updates</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The following versions include automatic updates by the WordPress application, which are separate from DreamHost's automatic updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress version 3.7 and later — automatic updates for all minor revision updates</li>
<li>WordPress version 5.6 and later — automatic updates for all major &amp; minor revision updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Deactivating DreamHost's automatic updates does not change this behavior. DreamHost highly recommends that you allow these updates to automatically occur since they typically include bug fixes and/or security updates.</p>
<p>If needed, you can use a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/configuring-automatic-background-updates/#update-configuration" target="_self">plugin</a> to disable automatic updates.</p>
</div>
<p>If you prefer to manually update your WordPress install, you can use the following instructions to opt-out of automatic updates by removing your site from the One-Click Installs list:</p>
