<p>The following instructions help you create a safe copy of your DreamPress site for testing purposes, without affecting your existing one. For example, you can set up a new instance of DreamPress on a different domain and then import your existing WordPress site to it. Once you're finished testing, delete it to avoid extra costs.</p>

<p>You can import a current WordPress install into a temporary DreamPress site. This allows you the ability to use the temporary domain as a testing environment before migrating to your actual site URL. View the following articles for details on how to create a DreamPress temporary domain:</p>

<h2>Importing into DreamPress</h2>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=dreampress.dashboard&amp;">Panel &gt; 'DreamPress' &gt; 'Dashboard'</a>) page.</li>
<li>If you want to change the name of your WordPress install to another domain while importing, create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214583258-How-do-I-add-DreamPress-to-a-new-domain-">new DreamPress installation</a>. <br> If you want to test your import on a temporary domain, create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002837508-Creating-a-DreamPress-temporary-domain">temporary DreamPress site</a>.

<li>Click the 'Domain' tab on the bottom left.</li>
<li>On the bottom right, click the titled 'Import existing site'.

</li>
<li>Choose the site you'd like to import data from in the dropdown menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Start Import</strong> button to begin the import process.</li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a clone/copy of the WordPress site and changes the domain name. This is ideal for testing DreamPress, testing new plugins or themes, and so on, since it leaves the original site intact. It's also good for splitting out a single WordPress installation from a domain that has multiple apps. For example, you can turn example.com/blog into blog.example.com.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you're importing your WordPress install from a different domain name, the import tool will attempt to replace the domain/URLs. If it fails to do so, the email following the import will indicate that. In any case, you should always double check if this data is correct after the import has completed.</p>

</div>
<p>If you wish to migrate a different domain's WordPress content to a domain that you want on DreamPress, then you should add the domain first to DreamPress and then use the Import feature.</p>
