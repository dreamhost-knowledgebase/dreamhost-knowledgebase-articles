<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-tip">
<p>The following instructions help you create a safe copy of your DreamPress site for testing purposes, without affecting your existing one. For example, you can set up a new instance of DreamPress on a different domain and then import your existing WordPress site to it. Once you're finished testing, delete it to avoid extra costs.</p>
</div>
<p>You can import a current WordPress install into a temporary DreamPress site. This allows you the ability to use the temporary domain as a testing environment before migrating to your actual site URL. View the following articles for details on how to create a DreamPress temporary domain:</p>
