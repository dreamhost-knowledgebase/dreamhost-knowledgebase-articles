<h2>PHP 5.6 form errors</h2>
<p>PHP 5.6 handles certificates different than previous versions. This may cause your mail form to throw the following warning:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">Warning: stream_socket_enable_crypto</pre>
</div>
<p>View the following article for details on how to fix this warning:</p>

<p>Most software packages will show the name of the software in the admin section:</p>
<ul>
<li>To find this info, log into your site as you normally do and search for the software name and version number.</li>
<li>If you're unable to find the software name/version, then you may want to contact your web developer and confirm that the site they created is compatible with PHP 5.6.</li>
<li>If all else fails, you can always try switching the site to PHP 5.6 and look for any error messages on the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>The One-Click Installs have all been tested with PHP 5.6. If you’re running an older version of a one-click install app, DreamHost recommends that you upgrade to the current version.</p>
<p>View the following article for details on how to upgrade your One-Click Install app:</p>

<h2><span id="I.27m_running_Zend_Optimizer_.E2.80.93_what_do_I_need_to_do.3F">I'm running Zend Optimizer – what do I need to do?</span></h2>
<p>Zend Optimizer changed its name to <a href="http://static.zend.com/topics/Zend-Guard-Release-Notes-v5-5.txt">Zend Guard</a> between PHP version 5.2 and 5.3. Files encoded with Zend Optimizer using PHP 5.2 aren't compatible with Zend Guard using PHP 5.3+. To ensure a smooth transition to 5.5 or above, make sure your files are encoded to work with Zend Guard.</p>
<p>It's rather simple to activate Zend Guard using a custom phprc file, and instructions for that can be found here:</p>

<p>The only issue would be if you’re using some deprecated functions the newer version of PHP no longer supports. You can search for the function at <a href="http://php.net/">php.net</a>. Its page will confirm which versions of PHP still support it.</p>
