<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your website is hosted at the company where your domain registration's DNS is pointed. This is a combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Registrar</strong>: The company where your domain is registered</li>
<li><strong>The hosting company</strong>: The company where the DNS is pointed</li>
</ul>
<p>View the following article for an explanation of these terms:</p>

<h3>Checking where your domain is registered</h3>
<p>You can confirm the company where your domain is registered by running a WHOIS query. This can be done using online sites or via SSH. The following article explains how to run a WHOIS query.</p>

<h2>Different ways to point your DNS</h2>
</div>
<p>There are two DNS options to control where your site is hosted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the Nameservers (this must be done at your site's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857#registrar" target="_self">Registrar</a>)</li>
<li>Changing the A records</li>
</ul>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Nameservers</h3>
<p>All of your site's DNS records are controlled at the company where the Nameservers are pointed.</p>
<p>Changing your Nameservers points <strong>ALL</strong> of your site's DNS records to a specific company. This means your website, email, mysql, ftp, ssh, and any other records are then controlled at the new company.</p>
<p>You must log into the company where you purchased your domain registration in order to change the Nameservers. The company is called your domain's Registrar.</p>

<h3>A records</h3>
<p>A records are only the IP addresses of your website. This would be the IP address for the www and non-www version of your site. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>example.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you only point your A records to a different company, only your website is hosted at the new company. All of your other DNS records (email, mysql, ftp, ssh) continue to be hosted where your Nameservers are pointed.</p>
<p>The illustrations below show a few ways this could be implemented.</p>
