<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two DNS options to control where your site is hosted.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the Nameservers (this must be done at your site's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857#registrar" target="_self">Registrar</a>)</li>
<li>Changing the A records</li>
</ul>

<h2>Checking where your DNS is hosted</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article helps you to determine where your <strong>website</strong> is hosted. In order to figure this out, you must first check where your site's <strong>DNS</strong> is hosted.</p>
<p>The following article explains how to view where your current DNS records are pointed.</p>

<h2>What happens when you change your DNS?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Changing the Nameservers</h3>
<p>All of your site's DNS records are controlled at the company where the Nameservers are pointed.</p>
<p>Changing your Nameservers points <strong>ALL</strong> of your site's DNS records to a specific company. This means your website, email, mysql, ftp, ssh, and any other records are then controlled at the new company.</p>
<p>You must log into the company where you purchased your domain registration in order to change the Nameservers. The company is called your domain's Registrar.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857#registrar" target="_self">Domain Registrar</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing the A records</h3>
<p>A records are only the IP addresses of your website. This would be the IP address for the www and non-www version of your site. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>example.com</li>
<li>www.example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>If you only point your A records to a different company, only your website is hosted at the new company. All of your other DNS records (email, mysql, ftp, ssh) continue to be hosted where your Nameservers are pointed.</p>
<p>The illustrations below show a few ways this could be implemented.</p>
