<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Every installation of PHP comes with default settings which are usually fine for most websites. Occasionally, the needs of a website makes it necessary to adjust these PHP settings. For example, your site may need to upload files larger than the current PHP upload limit allows. In that case, you would need to create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini (phprc)</a> file, or access the existing <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file, and update this value.</p>
</div>
<h2>The DreamHost <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The standard term for a PHP configuration file is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini</a>. However, DreamHost uses the term <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file instead. This acts the same way â€“ only the name is different. In this article, only the term phprc is used.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Some variables (in particular, <span class="code">memory_limit</span>, <span class="code">post_max_size</span> and <span class="code">upload_max_filesize</span>) are subject to internal limitations; increasing them significantly beyond the default values will not work correctly and will cause issues with your site.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The default size limit for uploading files is 64MB, which may be far too small for your needs. If you need to raise this limit, you must create a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.&nbsp;View the following articles for instructions on how to create a <span class="text-object">phprc</span> file.</p>

</ul>
<p>To increase that limit to 512MB, use the following directives:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">upload_max_filesize = 600M
post_max_size = 650M
max_execution_time = 500
max_input_time = 500</pre>
</div>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>To upload large files, <span class="code">post_max_size</span> should be larger than <span class="code">upload_max_filesize</span>.</p>

<h2>Kill off all running php processes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">kill running php processes</a> to ensure your new settings take effect.</p>
</div>
<h2>Confirming your changes</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, you should check to confirm the values have updated. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-Viewing-your-site-s-PHP-version-and-settings">phpinfo.php file</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>
