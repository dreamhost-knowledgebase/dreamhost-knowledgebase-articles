<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Every installation of PHP comes with default settings which are usually fine for most websites. Occasionally, the needs of a website makes it necessary to adjust these PHP settings. For example, your site may need to upload files larger than the current PHP upload limit allows. In that case, you would need to create a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini (phprc)</a> file and update this value.</p>
<h2>The DreamHost phprc file</h2>
<p>The standard term for a PHP configuration file is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200688-php-ini-overview">php.ini</a>. However, DreamHost uses the term "phprc" file instead. This acts the same way – only the name is different. In this article, only the term phprc is used.</p>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Some variables (in particular, <code>memory_limit</code>, <code>post_max_size</code> and <code>upload_max_filesize</code>) are subject to internal limitations; increasing them significantly beyond the default values will not work correctly and will cause issues with your site.</p>

<p>The default size limit for uploading files is 64MB, which may be far too small for your needs. If you need to raise this limit, you must create a phprc file. View the following articles for instructions on how to create a phprc file.</p>

<p>To increase that limit to 100MB, use the following directives:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">upload_max_filesize = 100M
post_max_size = 105M
max_execution_time = 500
max_input_time = 500</pre>

<div class="alert-content">
<p>To upload large files, post_max_size should be larger than upload_max_filesize.</p>

<h2>Kill off all running php processes</h2>
<p>Make sure to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214200748-My-phprc-file-isn-t-updating">kill running php processes</a> to ensure your new settings take effect.</p>
<h2>Confirming your changes</h2>
<p>After you've edited the file and killed off all PHP processes, you should check to confirm the values have updated. You can do this by creating a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214895287-How-do-I-view-my-PHP-environment-settings-">phpinfo.php file</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see your changes have updated, try killing off your PHP processes again:</p>
