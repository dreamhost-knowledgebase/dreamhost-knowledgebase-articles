<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A subdomain is a domain or DNS record that is added to a primary domain. For example, if your primary domain was <strong>example.com</strong>, you could add a subdomain to it named <strong>blog.example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>The 'blog' part in front of the primary domain is what makes it a subdomain. This is because domains are read from the right to left. In the example of <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, the three sections break down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>.com — This is the top-level domain (TLD)</li>
<li>example.&nbsp;— This is your unique domain name</li>
<li>blog.&nbsp;— This is the subdomain</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Two ways to add a subdomain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two ways to add a subdomain at DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li>As its own Fully Hosted subdomain&nbsp;— This means it will be its own unique website.</li>
<li>As a Custom DNS record — This is only a DNS record that points away from DreamHost.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections explain both methods.</p>
</div>
<h2>Option 1 — Adding a Fully Hosted subdomain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Adding a Fully Hosted subdomain is the same as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">adding a primary domain</a>. For example, after adding your primary domain of <strong>example.com</strong>, you can then add a subdomain of <strong>blog.example.com</strong> in the same way. When you add the subdomain, it automatically is added to the <span class="panel-page">Manage Domains</span> page under the primary domain. You can then host a new website on this subdomain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Domains</a> page.
<dl>
<dd><em>The <span class="panel-page">Manage Domains</span> page opens:</em></dd>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_domains_add_new_domain_01.png" alt="Add_new_domain.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Hosting to a Domain / Sub-Domain</strong> button.</li>
<li>The first section on this page is titled <span class="text-section">Fully Hosted</span>. This is where you'll add the new subdomain.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>You cannot enter a subdomain in the <span class="text-section">DNS Only</span> section.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2018-06_panel_domains_add_new_subdomain_01.png" alt="Add_new_subdomain.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>In the field titled <strong>Domain to host:</strong> enter the name of the subdomain you wish to host. For example, if you wanted to 'Fully Host' the subdomain, add the subdomain <strong>blog.example.com</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Fully host this domain</strong>&nbsp;button to save.
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you receive the following error message:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">You can't add that domain: you must add the parent domain example.com to your account before adding a subdomain to it.</pre>
</div>
<p>It means that the primary domain is not yet in the system. A subdomain can only be created if its primary domain is created first (<strong>example.com</strong>). This is necessary even if you don't plan on hosting the second level domain at DreamHost.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the subdomain is set as Fully Hosted, an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217294917-IP-Address">IP</a> address is assigned. If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are not hosted with DreamHost you must point your A records to this IP.</p>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS article</a> for instructions on how to view this new IP address.</p>
</div>
<h2>Option 2&nbsp;— Adding a subdomain as a Custom DNS record</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are hosting the primary domain at DreamHost (<strong>example.com</strong>), but want to host the subdomain at another company (<strong>blog.example.com</strong>), you should create a 'Custom DNS' record instead. This allows you to set the IP address of the subdomain to point to another hosting provider.</p>
<p>View the following article that describes how to add an 'A Record' as a custom DNS record. This is the same method you'll use to create your subdomain.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>Propagation time</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After the domain is added, the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a>. This can take 4-6 hrs. You can use either of the following links to confirm that the DNS has updated in your location:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_self" rel="undefined">whatsmydns.net</a> — A popular site that checks DNS records around the world.</li>
<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360055964552-Viewing-your-DreamHost-DNS-records" target="_self">Viewing your DreamHost DNS records</a> — Use DreamHost's DNS propagation checker in the panel.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><span id="Can_I_add_an_email_for_a_subdomain.3F">Can I add an email for a subdomain?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes. Once the subdomain has been added to the <span class="panel-page">Manage Domains</span> page, go to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manage Email</a> section of your panel proceed with the configuration steps detailed in the following article:</p>

<p>The above examples show how to create a subdomain that is Fully Hosted at DreamHost, or points to a different hosting company. There are also a few other ways you can use with a subdomain at DreamHost. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirect</li>
<li>Mirrored</li>
</ul>
