<p>A subdomain is a domain or DNS record that is added to a primary domain. For example, if your primary domain was 'example.com', you could add a subdomain to it named 'blog.example.com'.</p>
<p>The 'blog' part in front of the primary domain is what makes it a subdomain. This is because domains are read from the right to left. In the example of 'blog.example.com', the three sections break down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>.com — This is the top level domain (TLD)</li>
<li>example. — This is your unique domain name</li>
<li>blog. — This is the subdomain</li>
</ul>
<h2>Two ways to add a subdomain</h2>
<p>There are two ways to add a subdomain at DreamHost.</p>
<ul>
<li>As its own Fully Hosted subdomain — This means it will be its own unique website.</li>
<li>As a Custom DNS record — This is only a DNS record that points away from DreamHost.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections explain both methods.</p>
<h2>Option 1 — Adding a Fully Hosted subdomain</h2>
<p>Adding a Fully Hosted subdomain is the same as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-">adding a primary domain</a>. For example, after adding your primary domain of 'example.com', you can then add a subdomain of blog.example.com in the same way. When you add the subdomain, it automatically is added to the 'Manage Domains' page under the primary domain. You can then host a new website on this subdomain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) page.
<dl>
<dd><em>The 'Manage Domains' page opens:</em></dd>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-06_panel_domains_add_new_domain_01.png" alt="Add_new_domain.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Hosting to a Domain / Sub-Domain</strong> button.</li>
<li>The first section on this page is titled 'Fully Hosted'. This is where you'll add the new subdomain.
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>You cannot enter a subdomain in the “DNS Only” section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-06_panel_domains_add_new_subdomain_01.png" alt="Add_new_subdomain.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>In the field titled <strong>Domain to host:</strong> enter the name of the subdomain you wish to host. For example, if you wanted to 'Fully Host' the subdomain, add the subdomain <strong>blog.example.com</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Fully host this domain</strong> button to save.
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you receive the following error message:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">You can't add that domain: you must add the parent domain example.com to your account before adding a subdomain to it.</pre>
</div>
<p>It means that the primary domain is not yet in the system. A subdomain can only be created if its primary domain is created first (example.com). This is necessary even if you don't plan on hosting the second level domain at DreamHost.</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the subdomain is set as Fully Hosted, an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217294917-IP-Address">IP</a> address is assigned. If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">nameservers</a> are not hosted with DreamHost you must point your A records to this IP.</p>
<p>View the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS article</a> for instructions on how to view this new IP address.</p>
<h2>Option 2 — Adding a subdomain as a Custom DNS record</h2>
<p>If you are hosting the primary domain at DreamHost (example.com), but want to host the subdomain at another company (blog.example.com), you should create a 'Custom DNS' record instead. This allows you to set the IP address of the subdomain to point to another hosting provider.</p>
<p>View the following article that describes how to add an 'A Record' as a custom DNS record. This is the same method you'll use to create your subdomain.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215414867#A_record">How do I add custom subdomain 'A record'?</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Propagation time</h2>
<p>After the domain is added, the DNS must <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a>. This can take 4-6 hrs. You can check the following site to confirm the DNS has updated in your location.</p>

</ul>
<h2><span id="Can_I_add_an_email_for_a_subdomain.3F">Can I add an email for a subdomain?</span></h2>
<p>Yes. Once the subdomain has been added to the 'Manage Domains' page, go to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Email' &gt; 'Manage Email'</a>) section of your panel proceed with the configuration steps detailed in the following article:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Other options for your subdomain</h2>
<p>The above examples show how to create a subdomain that is Fully Hosted at DreamHost, or points to a different hosting company. There are also a few other ways you can use with a subdomain at DreamHost. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redirect</li>
<li>Mirrored</li>
<li>Cloaked</li>
</ul>
