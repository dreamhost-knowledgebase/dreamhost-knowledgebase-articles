<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamCompute Ubuntu 14.04 Virtual Machines (VMs) launched prior to August 7, 2019, included an apt repository mirror. This mirror was hosted by DreamHost and set up to provide quick package downloads from VMs, and to reduce the load on Canonical’s apt repositories.</p>
<p>This mirrored apt repository has been decommissioned. After a few weeks of monitoring the mirror, DreamHost believes there are very few customers who will be affected by this work. However, if you are one of the few who may be affected, the following are some tips to help ensure your VM continues to work as expected.</p>
</div>
<h2>Who is affected?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">To determine if you are affected, run the following command:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">grep mirrors.dreamcompute.com /etc/apt/sources.list</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>If nothing returns from this command, you are <strong>NOT&nbsp;</strong>affected and can continue using your VM as is. However, if you are affected by this work, you will see a result that looks similar to the following:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">grep mirrors.dreamcompute.com /etc/apt/sources.list</span>
deb http://mirrors.dreamcompute.com/ubuntu/ trusty main restricted
deb-src http://mirrors.dreamcompute.com/ubuntu/ trusty main restricted
deb http://mirrors.dreamcompute.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates main restricted
deb-src http://mirrors.dreamcompute.com/ubuntu/ trusty-updates main restricted</pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>What to do if you’re affected</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you are affected by this mirror work, you have a few options on how to continue.</p>
<h3>Option one: Building a new VM</h3>
<p>The most disruptive solution would be to build a new VM and migrate your workload to this VM. Specifics on how to do this depends entirely on what software is running and how sensitive it is to changes such as IPs, OS versions, and so on.</p>
<h3>Option two: Mirroring your VM</h3>
<p>Even though DreamHost won’t be hosting a mirror of Ubuntu-14.04, Canonical has committed to continuing to provide support for Ubuntu-14.04 until April of 2022. As such, you can change the mirror your VM uses to point at Canonical’s <a href="http://iad-2.clouds.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/">apt repository</a>.</p>
<p>The following are three different methods to accomplish this:</p>
<p><strong>Method #1</strong></p>
<p>Edit the file by hand using the <span class="code">vim</span> command:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Method #2</strong></p>
<p>Edit the file using the <span class="code">sed</span> command:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">sudo sed -i 's/mirrors.dreamcompute.com/iad-2.clouds.archive.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Method #3</strong></p>
<p>Modify the file using a simple Ansible playbook. The following example is a simple playbook you can run (<span class="code">ansible-playbook fixit.yml</span>) to swap out the apt mirrors:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">---
- name: Update apt mirrors
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  connection: local
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Replace old mirror with new mirror
      replace:
        path: /etc/apt/sources.list
        regexp: mirrors.dreamcompute.com
        replace: iad-2.clouds.archive.ubuntu.com</pre>
</div>
</div>
