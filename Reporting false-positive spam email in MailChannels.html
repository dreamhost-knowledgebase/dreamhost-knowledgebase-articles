<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There may be situations when email you send is returned back to you and marked as spam.&nbsp;This is because DreamHost scans all outbound email for potential spam—and since it is not possible to disable this feature, you can instead mark the returned email as a "false positive" in order for it to successfully send from the DreamHost mail server.</p>
<p>It's also possible that incoming email may be incorrectly marked as Spam. In this case, you should report these falsely flagged emails to DreamHost support so they may be reported to the filtering service in order to train the filter.</p>
<p>The following instructions describe how to find information in the bounced email in order to mark it as a false-positive spam message or report a falsely flagged email to DreamHost.</p>

<p>A bounced message that DreamHost flags as spam is sent to you, which contains further information on how to handle a suspected spam message. Use the following steps to open the MailChannels dashboard in order to mark it as a false positive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your email application and view your messages.
<dl>
<dd><em>A bounced message that DreamHost suspects is spam appears as follows:</em></dd>
</dl>
<div class="text-blockquote">&lt;example@example.com&gt;: host smtp.mailchannels.net[52.43.13.119]<br />said: 550 5.7.1 [CS] Message blocked. If this is a false positive,<br />please report this to your hosting service provider. See https://console.mailchannels.net/insights/bounce<br />(in reply to end of DATA command)</div>
</li>
<li>Click the link in the email to open the MailChannels dashboard. The above example shows the <span class="text-link">https://console.mailchannels.net/insights/bounce</span> link, but the one you see may be different.
<dl>
<dd><em>An email status&nbsp;box opens in MailChannels.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Not Spam</strong> button to mark the message as a false-positive email.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Confirm</strong> button when the pop-up box appears, which confirms that the message wasn't spam and you're reporting it as a false positive.
<dl>
<dd><em>After you confirm it, the following success message appears.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Reporting a message as a "false positive" will not resend the message. You will need to manually resend the bounced message afterwards.</p>
