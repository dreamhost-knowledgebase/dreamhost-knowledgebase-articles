<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There may be situations when email you send is returned back to you and marked as spam.&nbsp;This is because DreamHost scans all outbound email for potential spamâ€”and since it is not possible to disable this feature, you can instead mark the returned email as a "false positive" in order for it to successfully send from the DreamHost mail server.</p>
<p>It's also possible that incoming email may be incorrectly marked as Spam. In this case, you should report these falsely flagged emails to DreamHost support so they may be reported to the filtering service in order to train the filter.</p>
<p>The following instructions describe how to find information in the bounced email in order to mark it as a false-positive spam message or report a falsely flagged email to DreamHost.</p>
