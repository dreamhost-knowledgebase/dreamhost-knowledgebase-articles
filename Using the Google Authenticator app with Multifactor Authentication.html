<h2 id="h_01HFSJ4JYNX1PDWK9103K7CVE3">Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The Google Authenticator app was chosen because it's free and widely available on Android, iOS/Apple, BlackBerry, or Windows mobile devices, and other third-party APIs/Apps. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Lastpass</li>
<li>KeepSafe</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/two-factor/">WordPress Two-Factor</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/heapsource/active_model_otp">Rails</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tadeck/onetimepass">Python</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gbraad/gauth">HTML5</a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Google Authenticator is particularly useful with mobile tablets/phones with a cellular or Internet connection. In the event of a lost or disconnected mobile device, Google Authenticator also provides a list of non-expiring backup codes (during the initial configuration) that can be used. Outside of the Google Authenticator app, SMS text message or voice calls can be used to obtain the 2nd layer code.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Before you can enable Multifactor Authentication on your DreamHost account, you'll need to install the Google Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet device.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you already have the Google Authenticator app on your smartphone or tablet device, you just need to click the "+" in the lower right corner (iOS) or open the settings for the app and click "Add account" (Android). Then proceed to the next section of this walkthrough.</p>
</div>
<p>Google's official documentation on downloading and installing the app can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Get verification codes with Google Authenticator</a> - Google Account Help</li>
</ul>
<p>The app can be downloaded from your device's App Store (or use Google's direct link for BlackBerry):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2">Android devices: Google Play</a></li>

<div class="notebox-note">
<p>DreamHost recommends time-based one-time passcodes. Time-based codes provide better protection against phishing and keyloggers since each code is only valid for a short amount of time. Time-based codes also automatically stay in sync with DreamHost’s servers, as opposed to counter-based codes which require manual syncing.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use counter-based codes, you will need to press the <strong>refresh</strong> button next to the code in the Google Authenticator App each time you use it to advance it to the next code.</li>
</ul>

<li>Use the Google Authenticator app to scan the QR code.
<ul>
<li>If your device does not have a camera, you can instead enter the 16-digit secret key shown below the QR code into the app manually.</li>
<li>If you have more than one device running Google Authenticator, scan the QR code or enter the key on every device that you want to use with your DreamHost account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the Google Authenticator app displays a 6-digit passcode, enter it in the passcode field.

<li>DreamHost highly recommends <strong>saving the backup codes</strong> presented in the ‘Success!’ dialog box. Make sure you write them down before exiting the page.</li>
<li>If you suspect your account may be compromised (for example if you have lost your phone or mobile device), and you're using Google Authenticator, you can use the <strong>Regenerate Key</strong> button to invalidate the old key and create a new one.</li>
