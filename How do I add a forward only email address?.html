<p>A forward-only email address is an email address that does not have an active mailbox. This is because this user’s primary function is to forward all email sent to it to another email user. The message will only be stored on the user that is set to receive the forwarded email.</p>

The columns in the screenshot above are for forward-only email addresses, which do not have an active mailbox. Because of this, these users are listed separately from the users that do have active mailboxes.

<h2><span id="Description_of_fields_in_the_forward-only_email_page">Description of fields in the forward-only email page</span></h2>
<p><strong>Forwarding-Only Addresses</strong>: In this column, you will only see the email address of the forwarding user because there is no active mailbox to show any details for.</p>
<p><strong>Forwards to</strong>: This column will show the email address of the user that will receive the messages sent to this forwarding user. You can add more than one if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong>: This column has two options for each user listed: Edit and Delete.</p>
<dl>
<dd><strong>Edit</strong>: The edit button takes you to another page where you can make changes to your forward address.</dd>
<dd><strong>Delete</strong>: Clicking this button deletes the user, but a pop-up window displays prompting you to verify this request first with the message:</dd>

<pre class="prebox">Really delete forwarduser@example.com? (There is no email stored with it.)</pre>

<dd>Clicking “OK” will delete the user and the mailbox for that user. This will require a few minutes, but once this is done, you will no longer see that user listed on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=mail.addresses&amp;" target="_blank">Manage Email</a> page for that domain.</dd>
