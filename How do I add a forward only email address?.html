<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A forward-only email address is an email address that does not have an active mailbox. This is because this user’s primary function is to forward all email sent to it to another email user. The message will only be stored on the user that is set to receive the forwarded email.</p>
<div class="alert-warning">
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> set an active email address to a forward-only address. This will delete all email previously saved under this address.</p>
