<h2>How long after I sign up can I start building my site?</h2>
<p>If your account is automatically approved, you may proceed with creating your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> user which will allow you to upload your files within 30 minutes of account approval. If your account is not automatically approved, it will be manually reviewed by DreamHost. This usually takes about 24 hours, not including weekends or holidays.</p>
<p>However, it will take a bit longer for your domain name to work online. New domain registrations typically take 24-72 hours to be viewable online due to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS propagation</a>.</p>
