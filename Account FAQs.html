<h2>How do I sign up for an account?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Opening a DreamHost account to register a domain or host your website is a straightforward process, which takes just a few moments to complete. You can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">sign up</a> immediately using most credit cards or PayPal. New accounts are often approved automatically. However, if there are payment issues, an account may be held for manual review and you may need to provide additional account verification information.</p>
</div>
<h2>Is it possible to sign up without a credit card?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes. When you <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-sign-up-for-a-DreamHost-account">sign up for an account</a>, the form also offers PayPal as an option.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="Is_there_a_way_to_try_out_DreamHost_services_before_signing_up.3F">What email address should I use to sign up?</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It's recommended to use a 3rd party email such as a GMAIL or OUTLOOK address.</p>
<p>It is <strong>NOT</strong> recommend you use any email that is on one of your domains. For example, if you plan on hosting a site with DreamHost named 'example.com', do not use an address such as 'contact@example.com'.</p>
<p>The reason is that if your domain registration expires, or you are no longer hosting email, you will fail to receive DreamHost related emails. If you're using a 3rd party email, you'll always receive DreamHost announcements at that external address.</p>

<p>At this time there is no demo account to test out. However, DreamHost offers a 97 day money back guarantee for any credit card purchase on a Shared web hosting plan. If you find DreamHost does not suit your needs, cancel within 97 days and get a full refund. View the <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/legal/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> for further details.</p>
</div>
<h2>How long after I sign up can I start building my site?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your account is automatically approved, you may proceed with creating your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> user which will allow you to upload your files within 30 minutes of account approval. If your account is not automatically approved, it will be manually reviewed by DreamHost. This usually takes about 24 hours, not including weekends or holidays.</p>
<p>However, it will take a bit longer for your domain name to work online. New domain registrations typically take 24-72 hours to be viewable online due to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS propagation</a>.</p>
