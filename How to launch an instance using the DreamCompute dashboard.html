<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=cloud.compute&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DreamCompute</a> page and log into your DreamCompute dashboard.</li>
<li>On the top left, click the <span class="text-object">Compute</span> tab.</li>
<li>From the expanded list, click '<span class="guilabel">Instances'</span>.
<p><em>The dashboard shows any existing instances with their information.</em></p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3 id="h_01HA8DEKVDQS8SBJFV7MNKAE28">Select Boot Source (4 options)</h3>
<p>There are four options for boot source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Instance Snapshot</li>
<li>Volume</li>
<li>Volume Snapshot</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><strong>Image&nbsp;</strong>(select to create a new instance)</p>
<p>Select this option if you want to use a DreamHost curated image or if you have uploaded your own image. Once selected, a list of available images appears at the bottom that you can use to create your new instance from. (For example, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.)</p>
<p>Click the <img class="text-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/up_arrow.png" alt="" /> button to the right of the image to select it. If you choose to 'Create New Volume' (which is the default option), make sure to also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter a 'Volume Size' (otherwise your volume will default to the minimum required size of the image you select).</li>
<li>Choose if you'd like the volume deleted when you delete the instance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instance snapshot</strong></p>
<p>Select this option if you have an existing 'Instance Snapshot' from an existing or previous instance. Once selected, a list of available snapshots appears at the bottom that you can use to create a new instance from.</p>
<p>Click the <img class="text-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/up_arrow.png" alt="" /> button to the right of the image to select it. If you choose to 'Create New Volume' (which is the default option), make sure to also:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter a 'Volume Size' that matches the size of your 'Instance Snapshot'.</li>
<li>Choose if you'd like the volume deleted when you delete the instance.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Volume</strong></p>
<p>Select this option if you have an existing Volume you would like to create an instance form. Once selected, a list of available volumes is displayed.&nbsp;Click the <img class="text-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/up_arrow.png" alt="" /> button to the right of the volume to select it. Make sure to also choose if you would like the volume deleted when you delete the instance.</p>
<p><strong>Volume Snapshot</strong></p>
<p>Select this option is you have an existing “Volume Snapshot” that you would like to create an instance from. Once selected, a list of available volume snapshots is displayed. Click the <img class="text-icon" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/up_arrow.png" alt="" /> button to the right of the volume snapshot to select it. Make sure to also choose if you would like the volume deleted when you delete the instance.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HA8DEKVD83C4E16QB8RHP3DX">Three configuration options</h3>
<p>Depending on which of these dropdown options you select, you may see up to three additional options for managing your instance’s boot source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create New Volume</li>
<li>Volume Size (GB)</li>
<li>Delete Volume on Instance Delete</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><strong>Create New Volume</strong></p>
<p>The "Create New Volume" option determines whether your instance uses an 80 GB ephemeral boot disk or a volume boot disk of your chosen size. View the following article for further details.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/217701757-What-s-the-difference-between-ephemeral-and-volume-boot-disks-" target="_self">What's the difference between ephemeral and volume boot disks?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Volume Size</strong></p>
<p>The "Volume Size (GB)" option determines the size of your volume boot disk.</p>
<p><strong>Delete Volume on Instance Delete</strong></p>
<p>The "Delete Volume on Instance Delete" option determines whether or not the volume boot disk is deleted when you delete the instance. By default, this is set to "No" (which is recommended). This allows you to delete the instance and use the existing volume as the boot source of a new instance.</p>
