<p>When you have finished setting up the domain at SquareSpace, a list of DNS settings specific to SquareSpace appears. Make a note of these, as you'll need to add them to your DreamHost panel in the next step.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>After the domain is set up at SquareSpace, log into your <a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com">DreamHost panel</a>
</li>
<li>Set your domain to <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056398191-Setting-your-domain-to-DNS-Only-" target="_self" rel="undefined">DNS Only</a>. If you are trying to point a subdomain to SquareSpace, you'll need to add the records in the next step as <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035516812-Adding-custom-DNS-records#A_record" target="_self">Custom DNS records</a> instead.

<dd><em>After the domain is set to DNS Only, you can then add your SquareSpace DNS records.</em></dd>

</li>
<li>Add the following to your DreamHost panel:
<ul>
<li>2 different CNAME records</li>
<li>4 different A records</li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>View the following page from SquareSpace which details which records to add:</p>

<p>Once those 6 DNS records are added to your DreamHost panel, it may take 6 or more hours to update online. You can check the status of your DNS changes using either of the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li>
