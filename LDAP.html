<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol and is a networking protocol for searching and modifying directory services.</p>
<p>LDAP is a common protocol to access data that is stored in a central directory services server (database). There are many different directory services servers such as (slapd, IBM Lotus Domino Directory, Microsoft Active Directory, Mozilla Open Directory Project, Novell eDirectory, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service#Directory_services_software">and others</a>)</p>
<p>Many email address books (like Apple's included "Address Book".app) have built-in LDAP support.</p>

<h2><span id="Uses">Uses</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>LDAP can be used to access user information that is stored in a directory services server (a database of user details such as name, permissions, email address). That information may include user data and permissions for a complex website, or collaborative address book data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Email users would use LDAP to access a directory service to search for a user's email address.</li>
<li>Web application developers would use LDAP in their application designs to centrally store and retrieve authorized user information stored in a directory service via LDAP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why? The benefit of a central directory service (user database) is that several web applications could all save time and resources by sharing the same user data.</p>

<p>LDAP system packages are installed on all DreamHost servers, however PHP libraries are not. To use LDAP, you would need to manually <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215074947-How-to-install-a-custom-version-of-PHP">install a custom version of PHP.</a>&nbsp;During installation,&nbsp;adjust the <span class="text-object">make</span> file to use the correct location of libldap.so.</p>
<p>LDAP is not suited for shared hosting as it uses a lot of CPU resources. <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215280058-Private-Server-overview">VPS</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215279658-Dedicated-Server-overview">Dedicated</a> Hosting is the best option.
