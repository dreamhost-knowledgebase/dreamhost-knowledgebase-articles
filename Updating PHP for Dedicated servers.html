<p>DreamHost doesn't recommend switching to an admin user so you can select an older version of PHP – this could lead to your site being vulnerable to any exploit that may be out in the wild for that script and version of PHP. If your website is using a script that is not up-to-date then you run the risk of that script being compromised and malicious actions can be made on your server.</p>
