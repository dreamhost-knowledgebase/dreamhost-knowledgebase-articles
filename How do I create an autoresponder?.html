<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Autoresponders allow you to automatically respond to messages sent to you. This can be highly convenient if you are going to be unable to access email for a while, or need to reply to everyone that emails a specific address with the same reply. Please note that each email address that contacts you will only receive one copy of the auto-response per day. So, if you test three times, you will only receive a single response.</p>
<p>Autoresponders automatically send a pre-written email to anyone who writes to a designated email address on your domain while still receiving the original emails.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You go on vacation for a week, somewhere without Internet access. You can set up an autoresponder to let folks know you will not respond to their email immediately.</li>
<li>You have a web page devoted to your business, and a thousand people a day write to you asking for more information about it. You can set up a new email address, such as example@example.com, then create an autoresponder for this alias which contains whatever information you feel would be relevant. Now, every time someone writes to the address you configured, an email with that information is sent to them, and you do not have to take any further action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Autoresponder FAQs</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<h3>Can I send HTML-encoded autoresponders?</h3>
<p>Yes. To enable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the checkbox titled <span class="text-object">Is this HTML?</span> which enables HTML tags in your message to be interpreted as HTML (for mail clients that have HTML capabilities).</li>
<li>Paste your HTML code directly into the text area that says "Message:"</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, if some recipients who receive your autoresponder can't read HTML-formatted email: your message is sent as a multi-part message – those who can't read HTML will also receive a plain text version.</p>
<h3>How do I start or stop an autoresponder? Can I reschedule it?</h3>
<p>Each autoresponder has start and stop fields which are empty by default. You can set an autoresponder to 'active' with a specific start and stop date. It will then automatically start sending autoresponses at the specified start date and time and stop sending them at the stop date and time.</p>
<p>You can also leave the fields blank for it to function continuously.</p>
<h3>My autoresponder isn’t working – what can I do?</h3>
<p>The first thing to do when your autoresponder is not working is to confirm that all the settings are correct. Also, if you have input a 'starting/stopping' time it must be set in Pacific Time, and not your local time. If all the settings are correct and it has been more than an hour since you last saved changes, please <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview">contact support</a> for further assistance.</p>
