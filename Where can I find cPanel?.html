<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The following describes the differences between cPanel and the DreamHost panel.</p>
<h2>What is cPanel?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cpanel.com/">cPanel</a> is a popular commercial web application that many major hosting companies use to manage all aspects of a hosting account.</p>
<h2>Does DreamHost offer cPanel?</h2>
<p>cPanel is not available at DreamHost. Instead, DreamHost uses a custom-built panel to manage your websites, databases, email, and billing. Many customers find that the DreamHost panel is more intuitive and easier to use than cPanel. You can log into your DreamHost panel at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com" target="_self">https://panel.dreamhost.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you are still able to import all of your former data into your DreamHost panel. The following section explain how to do this.</p>
<h2>Can I import my cPanel backup file into the DreamHost panel?</h2>
<p>cPanel offers the option to backup all of your data in a .tar.gz file. This contains all of your sites, databases, and email accounts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no automated way to import this file into your DreamHost panel. The only option is to manually migrate each part of the backup. Visit the following articles for further assistance:</p>

<h2>Can DreamHost import my content for me?</h2>
<p>DreamHost support is unable to migrate this data for you. You would need to use the links above to upload this data manually.</p>
<p>However, DreamHost support is available to assist you with any problems you may encounter when importing your data. If you have any questions during the process, you can contact support at any time:</p>
