<h2>Proving non-profit status</h2>
<p>Whether you are a new customer or a current customer, in order to prove your non-profit status DreamHost must receive one crucial piece of documentation: an official United States IRS letter indicating tax exempt non-profit status under the appropriate sections of the tax code. This is often called a <strong>501(c)(3) determination letter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A 501(c)(3) determination letter is the only documentation that DreamHost accepts.</strong></p>
