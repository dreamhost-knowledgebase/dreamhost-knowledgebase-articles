<p>Building a website from scratch can be a very time consuming and difficult task. However, there are various pre-assembled applications you can install which immediately create a fully functioning site. At DreamHost, these are called One-Click Installs and a full list of applications can be found on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=goodies.installer&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Goodies' &gt; 'One-Click Install'</a>) page.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen and installed your application, the DreamHost One-Click Installer does all the hard work for you. Once the software is automatically installed, you’ll receive an email containing any further instructions you need to follow in order to complete the installation of your chosen application.</p>
<h2>Contacting support</h2>
<p>If you do not receive the install email that provides the instructions on how to finish the installation, you can always check your "Support History" in the Control Panel on the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=support.his&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Support' &gt; 'Support History'</a>) page for an archived copy of that email.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>MySQL errors</h3>
<p>If you receive a MySQL error immediately after you install a One-Click application, it's often because the database has not yet set up completely. Just wait a few minutes for everything to configure through DreamHost and for your DNS to update online. When you return to your site after a brief wait, the installation should be ready to use.</p>
<p>If a MySQL error persists and you cannot connect to the database, make sure you use the proper MySQL Hostname, Database Name, MySQL User Name, and MySQL Password when you complete the installation.</p>
