<p>This article explains how to locate your DreamHost email DNS records.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Domains use several different types of DNS records. This article is specifically about email DNS records.</p>

<h2>Confirming where your email DNS records are managed</h2>
<p>Your email DNS records are managed at the company where your domain's nameservers are pointed. The following article explains how to view where your domain's nameservers are pointed.</p>

<p>Your DreamHost email DNS records are pointing to a different company. In order to use DreamHost email, you must point your DNS to DreamHost using one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point your nameservers (recommended)</li>
<li>Point individual records (A, CNAME, DKIM, MX, SRV, TXT, etc)</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The best option is to point your nameservers to DreamHost since this points ALL of your DNS records to DreamHost, including email.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>The only reason to not point your nameservers is if you have specific services you need to continue hosting at another company. In that case, you would need to manually set up all individual email DNS records (shown below) at the host where your domain's <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> is currently managed.</p>
</div>

<h2>Option 1: Pointing your nameservers to DreamHost</h2>
<p>If your domain is registered at another company and you would like all of your DNS records hosted at DreamHost, it's recommended you point your nameservers to DreamHost. View the following article for a list of common hosting companies and instructions on how to do this:</p>
<ul class="article-list">

</ul>
<h2>Option 2:&nbsp;Pointing individual DNS records to DreamHost</h2>
<p>If your domain is registered at another company but you are unable to point your nameservers to DreamHost, you'll need to point individual DNS records to DreamHost instead.</p>
<p>The following steps explain how to view the email DNS records configured for your domain at DreamHost. You will then need to add these at the company where your nameservers are currently pointed.</p>
