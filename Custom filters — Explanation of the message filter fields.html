<p>The following should be taken into consideration when creating filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order matters! The rules are checked one by one, so be sure you have them listed in the order you want them to be checked or executed.</li>
<li>Most rules should end with "execute and stop". Only use "execute and continue" if you wish to do multiple actions to a single incoming email.</li>

<ul>
<li>match "George" in "To: George of the Jungle &lt;george@example.com&gt;"</li>

<p>Tip: Combine this rule with using '+' for slightly customized email addresses for easy sorting of emails from websites. Give Amazon your email address as you+amazon@example.com and then you can easily filter those emails.</p>

<ul>
<li>The folder must already exist – the filter cannot make the folder for you. If you enter a folder name that does not exist, the <strong>emails will be deleted instead of moved</strong>.</li>
<li>Folder names are cAsE sEnSiTiVe! Double-check your folder name's spelling and shift key usage.</li>
<li>The filters cannot use folder names that have spaces in the name. Subfolders are okay, but must be specified with the parent folder and a '.', like ParentFolder.SubFolder. Folder names can only contain only letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and dashes. (But no leading dots, trailing dots, or double dots!)</li>

<h2><span id="Doing_more_than_one_action">Doing more than one action</span></h2>
<p>Each individual message filter can check for multiple things but can only perform a single action. You can use "execute and continue" to have multiple actions done on a single email. When a filter has "execute and continue" the action from the matching filter is taken, and then the next filter is checked and filtering continues. Normally, filters are made with "execute and stop" and the first rule that matches is the only action taken, and no more filters are checked.</p>
<p>Here's an example set of filters that check for spam and also sort mail into folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>add POSSIBLE SPAM to the subject of emails for any of the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>-contains viagra in the Subject</dd>
<dd>-contains diet in the Subject</dd>
<dd>-contains monkey in the Subject</dd>
<dd>and then <strong>continue</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>move emails to Amazon with Amazon in the Subject</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>and then <strong>stop</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>move emails to Twitter with twitter.com in the From</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>and then <strong>stop</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><span id="A_note_on_the_forwarding_rule">A note on the forwarding rule</span></h2>
<p>Forwarding will act very differently depending on the final ‘execute and stop’ or ‘execute and continue’ rule.</p>
<p>For example, a single filter set to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>forward and continue</strong> – forwards the email, after which a copy is also placed in your inbox.</li>
<li><strong>forward and stop</strong> – ends the filter chain before it reaches the end, so no message would be placed in your inbox.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="Using_message_filters_with_the_Junk_Mail_filters">Using message filters with Vade spam filters</span></h2>
<p>You can still use the message filters even if the domain is set up with Vade spam filters. Mail is filtered through the spam machines first, then gets routed to the regular incoming mail machines where your filters are then applied.</p>
