<p>The following should be taken into consideration when creating filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Order matters! The rules are checked one by one, so be sure you have them listed in the order you want them to be checked or executed.</li>
<li>Most rules should end with <span class="text-object">execute and stop</span>. Only use <span class="text-object">execute and continue</span> if you wish to do multiple actions to a single incoming email.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>How 'execute and stop' functions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The 'execute and stop' rule only applies to a rule that performs a delivery action such as moving the email to a folder.</p>
<p>If the rule is set to only add text to the HEADER or Subject, 'execute and stop' will not apply. In this case, the filter will continue to the next rule until it runs a rule with a delivery action. The following examples explain this further.</p>

<p>The text FILTERED is added to the subject, but the filter continues to the second rule.</p>

Use <span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>*</strong></span> before your term to match any part of the name or email address anywhere in the line.
<p>Tip: Combine this rule with using <span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large"><strong>+</strong></span> for slightly customized email addresses for easy sorting of emails from websites. Give Amazon your email address as <strong>you+amazon@example.com</strong> and then you can easily filter those emails.</p>

<p>Folder names are cAsE sEnSiTiVe! Double-check your folder name's spelling and <span class="code">Shift</span> key usage.</p>
<p>The filters cannot use folder names that have spaces in the name. Subfolders are okay, but must be specified with the parent folder and a period (e.g. <span class="text-object">ParentFolder.SubFolder</span>).

<h2><span id="Doing_more_than_one_action">Doing more than one action</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each individual message filter can check for multiple things but can only perform a single action. You can use "execute and continue" to have multiple actions done on a single email. When a filter has "execute and continue" the action from the matching filter is taken, and then the next filter is checked and filtering continues. Normally, filters are made with "execute and stop" and the first rule that matches is the only action taken, and no more filters are checked.</p>
<p>Here's an example set of filters that check for spam and also sort mail into folders:</p>
<ul>
<li>add POSSIBLE SPAM to the subject of emails for any of the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>-contains viagra in the Subject</dd>
<dd>-contains diet in the Subject</dd>
<dd>-contains monkey in the Subject</dd>
<dd>and then <strong>continue</strong></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>move emails to Amazon with Amazon in the Subject</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>and then <strong>stop</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>move emails to Twitter with twitter.com in the From</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>and then <strong>stop</strong>.</dd>

<p>You can still use the message filters even if the domain is set up with MailChannels spam filters. Mail is filtered through the spam machines first, then gets routed to the regular incoming mail machines where your filters are then applied.</p>
