<h2 id="h_01HC65TN7BGXYYA5C898ETD0A3">Automatic update features</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamHost's automatic updates are only available for sites with an active <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-Install-WordPress-using-the-DreamHost-WordPress-installer" target="_self">DreamHost WordPress installation</a>. Automatic updates include the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost performs an upgrade of your WordPress site 1–3 weeks following a major version release. If you wish to upgrade manually before then, you can do so by <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037291651-Manually-updating-WordPress" target="_self" rel="undefined">manually updating it in your WordPress dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>DreamHost also upgrades any available plugins during this process.</li>
<li>Once an upgrade completes, you are notified via email.</li>
<li>If any errors are found during the upgrade process, DreamHost will reverse the upgrade and notify you via email.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h_01HC65TN7BBPSXK968TQ83SES5">Automatic WordPress updates</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/configuring-automatic-background-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress automatic updates</a> are separate from DreamHost's automatic updates. Since they typically include bug fixes and/or security updates, DreamHost highly recommends that you allow these updates to automatically occur.&nbsp;The following versions include automatic updates by the WordPress application</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress version 3.7 and later — automatic updates for all minor revision releases</li>
<li>WordPress version 5.6 and later — automatic updates for all major &amp; minor releases</li>
</ul>
<p>Deactivating DreamHost's automatic updates does not change this behavior.&nbsp;</p>
