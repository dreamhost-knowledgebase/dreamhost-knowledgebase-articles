<p>Since DreamPress resides on <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216431827-Nginx-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nginx</a>, it is not possible to make any sort of configuration changes.

<ul>
<li>is provisioned automatically.</li>
<li>disallows root, sudo, and FTP access (you can still log in via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>).</li>

<li>includes any PHP version that WordPress recommends for its last three major releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, DreamHost has added built-in server caching, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is set up automatically for the DreamPress customer</li>
<li>responds to web requests as a proxy in front of the Nginx and PHP WordPress stack</li>
<li>is extremely efficient at caching content</li>
<li>allows this setup to scale to very high levels of traffic</li>
<li>comes with a static IP</li>

<h2 id="h_01HA2T09GCTFY7HHVYGT6BF0Z0">Service restrictions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress is a managed WordPress service, which means DreamHost has restricted certain actions that users can take that could irreparably break their WordPress site.</p>
<p>Each <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/wordpress/managed-wp-hosting/" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamPress plan</a> is configured for a single domain and a staging site. You can also mix and match it with Shared, VPS, and Dedicated Hosting.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HA2T09GCCNWV6KGZ9HFFW9E2">Current restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>No admin users or root SSH keys.</li>
<li>No FTP access. One SFTP (optional SSH) user and the domain you choose will be configured automatically.</li>
<li>Unable to add or remove databases or hostnames. The database and hostname will be created automatically for WordPress.</li>
<li>Unable to add Wildcard DNS.</li>
<li>Unable to delete the SSL certificate automatically installed.</li>
<li>Unable to adjust HTTPS settings.</li>
<li>Unable to directly add custom cache or <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> rules. You can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/218084068-Contacting-support-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact support</a> for assistance if your site requires either.</li>
<li>Network (Multisite) installs not supported.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small number of required plugins are auto-installed and updated by DreamHost.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannot add Unique IP addresses.</span>&nbsp;</li>

<h2 id="h_01HA2T09GC35P8VQ0PGAJ70K46">User support</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress comes with support from some of DreamHost’s top tech support, who also have experience in WordPress. After intensive training and evaluation by in-house WordPress core contributors, they were selected as the best-in-class to represent DreamHost and WordPress, and help you with any problems with your DreamPress site. If they don’t know the answer, they know how to find someone who does.</p>
<p>That said, please note that DreamHost support is not a replacement for an actual website developer (should you need one); DreamHost can help install/configure plugins but cannot create custom plugins or themes. Also, if a plugin or theme is causing problems, the only support DreamHost may be able to provide is disabling the plugin/theme and suggesting alternatives.</p>
