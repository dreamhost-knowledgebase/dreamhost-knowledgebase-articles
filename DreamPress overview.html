<h2>Technical details</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Service restrictions</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress is a managed WordPress service, which means DreamHost has restricted certain actions that users can take that could irreparably break their WordPress site.</p>
<p>DreamHost offers various DreamPress <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/wordpress/">plans</a> for both single or multiple sites. You can also mix and match it with Shared, VPS, and Dedicated hosting as well.</p>
<h3>Current restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unable to manually set memory. The memory is configured and scales if needed.</li>
<li>No admin users or root SSH keys.</li>
<li>No FTP access. One SFTP (optional SSH) user and the domain you choose will be configured automatically.</li>
<li>Unable to add or remove databases or hostnames. The database and hostname will be created automatically for WordPress.</li>
<li>Unable to add Wildcard DNS.</li>
<li>Unable to delete the SSL certificate automatically installed.</li>
<li>Unable to adjust HTTPS settings.</li>
<li>Network (Multisite) installs not supported.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<h2>WordPress version</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Since this is a managed service, it's not possible to control the version of WordPress. When a new update is available, the panel will automatically update your site.</p>
</div>
<h2>User support</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>DreamPress comes with support from some of DreamHost’s top tech support, who also have experience in WordPress. After intensive training and evaluation by in-house WordPress core contributors, they were selected as the best-in-class to represent DreamHost and WordPress, and help you with any problems with your DreamPress site. If they don’t know the answer, they know how to find someone who does.</p>
<p>All that said, please note that DreamHost support is <em>not</em> a replacement for an actual website developer (should you need one); DreamHost can help install/configure plugins, but <strong>cannot</strong> make custom plugins or themes for you. Also if a plugin or theme is causing problems, the only support DreamHost may be able to provide is disabling the plugin/theme and suggesting alternatives.</p>
