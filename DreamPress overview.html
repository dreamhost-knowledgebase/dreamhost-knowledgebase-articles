<p>DreamPress is DreamHost's managed <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215525287-WordPress-overview">WordPress</a> hosting. It's a scalable service that allows users to manage their WordPress sites with simple pricing, added benefits of server robustness, caching, and memory.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, it ties together different pieces of DreamHost's existing technology into a cohesive single unit. Below are all the details of this new service.</p>
<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>Each DreamPress instance is set up on DreamHost's cloud computing service called <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214840947-What-is-DreamCompute">DreamCompute</a>. New DreamPress services:</p>
<ul>
<li>are provisioned automatically</li>
<li>disallow root, sudo, and FTP access (You can still log in via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a> or <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>)</li>
<li>auto-scale RAM (memory) dynamically (customers cannot modify the RAM allocation)</li>
<li>come installed with a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216539558-Let-s-Encrypt-SSL-certificate-overview">free SSL 'Let's Encrypt' certificate</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, DreamHost added <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a> as a caching layer, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is set up automatically for the DreamPress customer</li>
<li>listens on port 80</li>
<li>responds to web requests as a proxy in front of the Apache and PHP WordPress stack</li>
<li>is extremely efficient at caching content</li>
<li>allows this set up to scale to very high levels of traffic</li>
<li>comes with a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216109647-Unique-IP-overview">Unique IP</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Service restrictions</h2>
<p>DreamPress is a managed service, which means DreamHost has restricted certain actions that users can take that would irreparably break their WordPress site.</p>
<p>DreamPress offers three different hosting plans for a single or multiple sites. You can also mix and match it with Shared, VPS, and Dedicated hosting as well.</p>
<h3>Current restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unable to manually set memory. The memory is configured and scales automatically.</li>
<li>No admin users or root SSH keys.</li>
<li>No FTP access. One SFTP (optional SSH) user and the domain you choose will be configured automatically.</li>
<li>Unable to add or remove databases or hostnames. The database and hostname will be created automatically for WordPress.</li>
<li>Unable to add Wildcard DNS.</li>
<li>Unable to delete the SSL certificate automatically installed.</li>
<li>Unable to adjust HTTPS settings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User support</h2>
<p>DreamPress comes with support from some of DreamHost’s top tech support, who also have experience in WordPress. After intensive training and evaluation by in-house WordPress core contributors, they were selected as the best-in-class to represent DreamHost and WordPress, and help you with any problems with your DreamPress site. If they don’t know the answer, they know how to find someone who does.</p>
<p>All that said, please note that DreamHost support is <em>not</em> a replacement for an actual website developer (should you need one); DreamHost can help install/configure plugins, but <strong>cannot</strong> make custom plugins or themes for you. Also if a plugin or theme is causing problems, the only support DreamHost may be able to provide is disabling the plugin/theme and suggesting alternatives.</p>
