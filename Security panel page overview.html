<p>DreamHost support may ask you a security question in the case you ever lose access to your account.</p>
<h2>IP Locking</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/ip-locking.png" alt="ip locking" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you enable the 'IP Locking' service, you will only be able to access your account from the current IP address you're logged in as. Every time you log into your account in the future, you must continue to use the same IP address. This is only recommended if you are sure your IP will not change and that you will always access your account from the same IP address.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/authorize-ip.png" alt="authorize ip" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you then attempt to access you site from a different IP address, you will see the following message. Click the 'here' link to reset your IP address.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/reset-ip.png" alt="reset ip" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You are then taken to a page where you can either enter your account's primary email address or an auth code you previously saved. If you submit your email address, you are mailed a long auth code that looks like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>275d686b553f1b45cea8d1cc4566d8fe</dd>
</dl>
<p>Visit the link sent in the email and enter this code. You are taken to the following page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/ip-reset.png" alt="reset ip" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>Choose how long you would like to authorize the current IP address you're using, then click the&nbsp;<strong>Authorize!</strong> button. A success message displays notifying you of the date this new IP address will expire.</p>
<h2>Active Sessions</h2>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/active-sessions.png" alt="active sessions" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>The 'Active Sessions' section displays all IP addresses that have logged into your panel. Your current session is displayed in bold text. You can end any other sessions shown by clicking&nbsp;<strong>End all sessions except this one</strong>.</p>
