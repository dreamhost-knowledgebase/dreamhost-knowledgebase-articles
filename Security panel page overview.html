<h2 id="h_01HYE701Z7QVQ6GEQ0YP3FSKSR">IP Locking</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you enable the <span class="text-product">IP Locking</span> service, you will only be able to access your account from the current IP address you're logged in as. Every time you log into your account in the future, you must continue to use the same IP address. This is only recommended if you are sure your IP will not change and that you will always access your account from the same IP address.</p>
<p>If you then attempt to access your site from a different IP address, you will see a warning message. Click the <span class="text-link">here</span> link to reset your IP address.</p>
<p>You are then taken to a page where you can either enter your account's primary email address or an auth code you previously saved. If you submit your email address, you are mailed a long auth code that looks like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>275d686b553f1b45cea8d1cc4566d8fe</dd>
</dl>
<p>Visit the link sent in the email and enter this code, you'll be taken to a new page. Choose how long you would like to authorize the current IP address you're using, then click the <strong>Authorize!</strong> button. A success message displays notifying you of the date this new IP address will expire.</p>
