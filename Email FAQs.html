<p>Unfortunately, emails will not work. If a message was sent to you and your domain expired, the sender will receive a bounce notification that the message was undelivered.

<p>No, DreamHost offers <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360024060072-Paid-email-plan" target="_self">paid email-only</a> hosting plans.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If you have a Shared Unlimited plan, you can create as many email addresses as you would like. There is no set number on how many addresses you can create.</p>
<p>If you have a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/360024060072-Paid-email-plan" target="_self">paid email-only</a> plan, you can create as many email addresses as you've signed up for.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Whenever you create a new email user account, you’re given the option to limit the total disk usage. By default, this is set to 1000 MB (1 GB). DreamHost recommends that if you do set a limit, raise that number if you're expecting to store/save a lot of mail through that new email address and leave it on DreamHost's servers (as opposed to downloading it off the server using a POP3 connection).</p>
<p>You can increase the disk size or remove the disk limit. More information on disk usage can be found in the following article:</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
