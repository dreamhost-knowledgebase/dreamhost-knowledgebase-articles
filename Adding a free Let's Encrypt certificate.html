<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article explains how to add a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate to your domain.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>Every domain must have its own separate certificate. This means that if you want an SSL cert for <strong>example.com</strong> and <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, you must add them separately.</p>
</div>
<p>Before you add the certificate, make sure the following are configured, otherwise the installation may fail.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HZ0JTB1G8GHPZ0F2XRBRG3E3">Step 1 — Configure hosting for your domain</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your domain must be either <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049378932-Adding-a-website-and-hosting" target="_self">Fully Hosted</a> or configured as a <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377-Redirect-a-domain" target="_self">redirect</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="h_01HZ0JTB1GXSC996K01ZY7BJSK">Step 2 — Point your DNS to DreamHost</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Your domain's DNS must already point to DreamHost.&nbsp;This is because 'Let's Encrypt' locates your domain using DNS. It then adds a <span class="text-object">.well_known/</span> directory to your site to authenticate the certificate.&nbsp;If your site's DNS does not resolve to DreamHost, the certificate will not be able to authenticate.&nbsp;One of the following options must be configured:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nameservers</li>
<li>A records</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HQPBTA6T0JQBW3H5Y3PC4QVK" class="subtoc-heading">Option 1 — Point your nameservers (Recommended)</h3>
<p>This option is recommended as it points ALL of your domain's DNS records to DreamHost, making them easier to manage. View the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467#checking-nameservers">Where are my nameservers pointed?</a> article to confirm where they are pointed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If they are already pointed to DreamHost</strong>: you do not need to change anything.</li>
<li><strong>If they are NOT pointed to DreamHost</strong>: you'll need to either <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385447-Change-nameservers-at-your-current-host">point them to DreamHost from your current host</a> or change your domain's A records as described below.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HQPBTA6T9YRT7AWAAAJW6KZR" class="subtoc-heading">Option 2 — Point your A records</h3>
<p>These records must be updated at the company where your nameservers are currently pointed. View the following article for instructions on how to find the correct IP address to point them to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DreamHost-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">What DreamHost DNS records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Log into your current host when your nameservers are pointed and update the following A records to point to your DreamHost domain.</p>
<p><strong>A records</strong></p>
<p>You must update both the A records for the www and the non-www records for your website. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>example.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If you're pointing to a subdomain such as <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, you'll still need to create the www record. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>blog.example.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>www.blog.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="h_01HZ0JW7MZPG8V4SCBSB0XPXSX">Step 3 — Disable your .htaccess file</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>If your site uses an <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> file, it must be temporarily disabled. This is because certain <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> rules such as IP blocking, rewrite rules, and password protection may cause the installation to fail.</p>
<p>To disable the file, rename it to something like <span class="text-object">.htaccess_OFF</span>. Then, install the certificate. Once installed, you can rename the file back to <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span>.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>If disabling your <span class="text-object">.htaccess</span> breaks your site, try adding the following rule, which should allow the installation to process:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteRule ^.well-known/(.*)$ - [L]
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQPBTA6VB3957643HJ77H4XC">Adding the certificate</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Once the steps above are complete, proceed with installing the certificate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Certificates</a> page.
<dl>
<dd><em>A list of your domains display.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to the right of your domain.</li>
<li>On the next page, click the <strong>Select this Certificate</strong>&nbsp;button.
<dl>
<dd><em>A Success message displays confirming the purchased certificate.</em></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQPBTA6VZ60GJSPNGV7CJRFB">Testing if the SSL certificate is working</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Confirm the certificate is functioning by visiting the secure <strong>HTTPS</strong> URL of your website at:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://</strong>example.com</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the browser bar shows a <span class="text-object">lock</span> icon confirming the connection is secure.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you just installed the certificate, you may need to wait a few hours for it to update online.</p>
