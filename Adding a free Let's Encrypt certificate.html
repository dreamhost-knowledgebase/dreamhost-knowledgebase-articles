<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>This article explains how to add a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate to your domain.</p>
<p>Every domain must have its own separate certificate. This means that if you want an SSL cert for <strong>example.com</strong> and <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, you must add them separately.</p>
</div>
<h2>Before adding the certificate</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="alert alert-note">

<div class="alert-content">
<p>Only a professionally-signed or 'Let's Encrypt' certificate will work with <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216475197-Cloudflare-with-SSL-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudflareâ€™s Full SSL (Strict) setup</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before you begin to add the certificate, make sure your domain is <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215416227-How-do-I-add-a-domain-" target="_self">Fully Hosted</a> or a&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215455377" target="_self">Redirect</a> domain and the DNS of your domain is already pointing to DreamHost. This means that either your Nameservers should be pointed to DreamHost, or your A records (www and non-www record) should be pointed to your domain's IP address (assuming your Nameservers are at a different company).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview">What are DreamHost's nameservers?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215414867#A_record">How to add an A record</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is because 'Let's Encrypt' adds a <span class="text-object">.well_known/</span> directory to your site to authenticate the certificate. If your site's DNS is not resolving to a Fully Hosted domain at DreamHost, the certificate cannot create this folder to authenticate and your panel will display the following:</p>
<p><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_lets-encrypt-unavailable.png" /></p>
<p>View the following sections to check your DNS values.</p>
<h3>Checking where your nameservers are pointed</h3>
<p>View the following link to check where your nameservers are pointed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467#checking-nameservers">Where are my nameservers pointed?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If they are already pointed to DreamHost, you do not need to change anything.</p>
<p>If they are NOT pointed to DreamHost, you'll need to either point them, or change your domain's two A records.</p>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216385467-Nameservers-overview" target="_self">Nameservers</a> are <strong>NOT</strong> hosted at DreamHost, you must add CAA records at your current DNS hosting company before adding an SSL certificate in the DreamHost panel. View the following article for further details.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029281672-CAA-policy-records">CAA policy records</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Updating your domain's A records</h3>
<p>As explained above, if your nameservers are not pointed to DreamHost and you do not wish to change them, the other option is to update your domain's two A records.</p>
<p>You'll need to update the www A record, and the non-www A record. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>www.example.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you're pointing a subdomain such as <strong>blog.example.com</strong>, you'll still need to create the www record. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>www.blog.example.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>blog.example.com</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>These must be updated at the company where your nameservers are pointed. View the following article for instructions on how to find the correct IP address to point them to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214694378-What-DreamHost-DNS-records-do-I-point-my-site-to-">What DreamHost DNS records do I point my site to?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>.htaccess rules</h3>
<p>Additionally, certain .htaccess rules such as IP blocking, rewrite rules, and password protection may cause the installation to fail. To play it safe, rename your .htaccess file (to something like .htaccess_OFF) in order to turn it off temporarily. Then, install the certificate. Once installed, you can rename the file back to .htaccess.</p>
<p>If disabling your .htaccess breaks your site, then add the following rule which should allow the installation to process:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">RewriteRule ^.well-known/(.*)$ - [L]
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Adding the certificate</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.secure&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL/TLS Certificates</a> page. A list of your domains display.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_add_button.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to the right of the domain you wish to add the SSL cert.
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/2019-01_panel_ssl_add.png" /></dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>On the next page click the&nbsp;<strong>Select this Certificate</strong>&nbsp;button.
<dl>
<dd><em>A Success message displays confirming the purchased certificate</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl></dl>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Test if the SSL certificate is working</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The certificate is now installed on your domain. Visit the secure URL of your website at:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>https://</strong>example.com</li>
</ul>
</ol>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" alt="Install_Comodo_Cert_08.png" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>You can see the browser bar shows a <span class="text-object">lock</span> icon confirming the connection is secure.</p>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-note-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>If you just installed the certificate, you may need to wait a few hours for it to update online.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Forcing your site to load HTTPS by default</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Even after you have added the SSL certificate to your site, visitors will not be able to use it unless they manually type in <span class="text-object">https</span> before your domain name. This defeats the purpose of adding it in the first place since the certificate is meant to protect all of your website traffic.</p>
<p>There are several ways to fix this. View the following article for instructions on how to create a configuration file to redirect all visitor traffic to the secure version of your URL (<span class="text-object">https</span>).</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<div class="alert alert-important">
<div class="alert-icon"><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/dh-kb-important-icon.svg" width="60" height="60" /></div>
<div class="alert-content">
<p>Redirecting to the <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> version of your URL only works for the same domain. This means that you can only redirect from <strong>http://example.com</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>https://example.com</strong>.</p>
<p>It is NOT possible to redirect to a different domain. For example:&nbsp;<strong>http://example1.com</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>https://example2.com&nbsp;</strong>would not function with a 'Let's Encrypt' certificate.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>After installing your certificate, you may find that your browser is still showing an insecure warning when visiting the <span class="text-object">HTTPS</span> version of your URL. There are a few reasons this could occur. Please view the following article for instructions on how to resolve this issue.</p>
