<p>DreamHost is aware of the situation and is actively working with relevant hosting, email, and registration providers to address the matter.</p>
<p>In the event that you entered any credentials through clicking any of the links in the message, DreamHost strongly recommends that you update your panel password on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/?tree=billing.secure">Security</a> page of the panel.</p>
<p>See the following article for more information on how to update your panel password:</p>
