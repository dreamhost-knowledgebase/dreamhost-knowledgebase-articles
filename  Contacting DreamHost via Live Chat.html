<p>When contacting support, DreamHost's goal is for you to have as close to 0 wait time as possible - within a few minutes via Live Chat. However, a technician may not be immediately available to respond – please be patient as DreamHost support works to address your issue.</p>
<p>Not all issues can be resolved promptly via chat. If, during your chat, your issue requires further investigation, the technician will instruct you to open a ticket (email) so that support may investigate your issue further.</p>
