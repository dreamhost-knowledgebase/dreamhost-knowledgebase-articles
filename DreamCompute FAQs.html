<div id="where-are-the-data-centers-located">
<h3>Where are the data centers located?</h3>
<p>DreamHost cloud services are currently located in the United States, but accessible from anywhere globally. DreamCompute is located in our Ashburn, Virginia (US-East) data center, and DreamObjects is located in our Irvine, California (US-West) data center.</p>

<div id="will-dreamcompute-scale">
<h3>Will DreamCompute scale?</h3>
<p>Yes. You can scale your apps both vertically and horizontally, by creating VMs with additional resources, or by spinning up additional VMs to handle similar or diverse infrastructure workloads (e.g. creating multiple load balancers, or separating web servers and databases). The unique networking features in DreamCompute enable developers and operations teams to design sophisticated n-tier architectures, with many VMs.</p>

<div id="can-i-scale-my-disk-volume-on-a-running-instance">
<h3>Can I scale my disk volume on a running instance?</h3>
<p>You can scale your disk volumes that are in use if you use <a class="reference external" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/">LVM</a> (Logical Volume Manager). It is recommended you use LVM when mounting your disk volumes for this reason. LVM allows you to continually add more disk space without any service interruption. If you don’t use LVM you would need to mount another (larger) volume, then copy your data from the old to the new volume.</p>

<div id="can-i-scale-my-cpu-or-memory-on-a-running-instance">
<h3>Can I scale my CPU or memory on a running instance?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! View the article below for instructions on scaling the vCPU and memory resources of a running instance.</p>

<div id="is-my-data-backed-up">
<h3>Is my data backed up?</h3>
<p>If you delete an instance or volume without first copying data off of it or creating an image-based snapshot, that data cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>However, DreamCompute block storage is based on Ceph which is a highly scalable, redundant, and self-healing storage technology. </p>
<p>Ceph is designed to deliver extreme durability of data, by creating and managing replicas of your data that are intelligently distributed across zones in different data centers. The system automatically detects potential corruption of data or potential failure or degradation of any storage node and immediately creates new replicas from redundant data copies, delivering enterprise-grade durability.</p>
