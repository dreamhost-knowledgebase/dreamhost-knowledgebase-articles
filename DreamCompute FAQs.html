<div id="what-are-the-pricing-plans">
<h3>What are the pricing plans?</h3>
<p>You only pay for what you use with a maximum monthly expense. No more confusing invoices or bills and no surprise at the end of the month. For example, if all you need is a lightspeed size machine (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) for 5 hours a month, you’ll pay 5 cents. If you use that for more than 25 days in a month, you’ll only pay a maximum of $6.</p>
<p>With any DreamCompute plan, you can easily create virtual machines, block devices, and networks using the DreamCompute Dashboard, or via OpenStack APIs and command-line tools.</p>

<div id="where-are-the-data-centers-located">
<h3>Where are the data centers located?</h3>
<p>DreamHost cloud services are currently located in the United States, but accessible from anywhere globally. DreamCompute is located in our Ashburn, Virginia (US-East) data center, and DreamObjects is located in our Irvine, California (US-West) data center.</p>

<div id="will-dreamcompute-scale">
<h3>Will DreamCompute scale?</h3>
<p>Yes. You can scale your apps both vertically and horizontally, by creating VMs with additional resources, or by spinning up additional VMs to handle similar or diverse infrastructure workloads (e.g. creating multiple load balancers, or separating web servers and databases). The unique networking features in DreamCompute enable developers and operations teams to design sophisticated n-tier architectures, with many VMs.</p>

<div id="can-i-scale-my-disk-volume-on-a-running-instance">
<h3>Can I scale my disk volume on a running instance?</h3>
<p>You can scale your disk volumes that are in use if you use <a class="reference external" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/">LVM</a> (Logical Volume Manager). It is recommended you use LVM when mounting your disk volumes for this reason. LVM allows you to continually add more disk space without any service interruption. If you don’t use LVM you would need to mount another (larger) volume, then copy your data from the old to the new volume.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-i-scale-my-cpu-or-memory-on-a-running-instance">
<h3>Can I scale my CPU or memory on a running instance?</h3>
<p>If you wish to add more memory or vCPU capacity to an instance, you will need to start a new larger instance. First, take a snapshot of your current instance, then start a new larger instance based on that snapshot.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-my-data-backed-up">
<h3>Is my data backed up?</h3>
<p>DreamCompute block storage is based on Ceph which is highly scalable, redundant, and self-healing storage technology. Ceph is designed to deliver extreme durability of data, by creating and managing replicas of your data that are intelligently distributed across zones in different data centers. The system automatically detects potential corruption of data or potential failure or degradation of any storage node and immediately creates new replicas from redundant data copies, delivering enterprise-grade durability.</p>
