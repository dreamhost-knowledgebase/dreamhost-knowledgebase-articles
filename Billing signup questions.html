<p>Opening a DreamHost account to register a domain or host your website is a straightforward process which takes just a few moments to complete. You can <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/223175988-How-to-signup-for-a-DreamHost-account-">sign up</a> immediately using most credit cards. New accounts are often approved automatically. However, if there are payment issues, an account may be held for manual review. In this case, you may need to provide additional account verification information.</p>
<h2>Can I have adult content on my DreamHost-hosted website?</h2>
<p>As long as the content is legal within the United States of America, you can host adult content. DreamHost does not restrict the content of sites hosted unless that content is illegal within the United States of America. Illegal content includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>blatant copyright infringement</li>
<li>libel</li>
<li>child pornography</li>
</ul>
<h2>Does DreamHost offer any special discounts for charitable organizations?</h2>
<p>Yes. To take advantage of DreamHost's charitable non-profit discount program, please view the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215769478-Non-profit-discount">Non-profit Discount page</a>.</p>
<p>This discount is applicable toward a single <strong><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/shared/">Shared</a></strong> hosting package per organization. Hosting packages that are already discounted as the result of a sale or other special promotion are not eligible to receive this discount. You must first sign up for a hosting package at the full price before the discount can be applied.</p>
<h2>How long after I sign up can I start building my site?</h2>
<p>If your account is automatically approved, you may proceed with creating your <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027-FTP-overview-and-credentials">FTP</a> user which will allow you to upload your files within 30 minutes of account approval. If your account is not automatically approved, it will be manually reviewed by DreamHost. This usually takes about 24 hours, not including weekends or holidays.</p>
<p>However, it will take a bit longer for your domain name to work online. New domain registrations typically take 24-72 hours to be viewable online due to <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">DNS propagation</a>.</p>
<h2>Iâ€™m not a resident of the United States. Can I still sign up?</h2>
<p>DreamHost currently hosts websites in hundreds of countries worldwide, so you do not need to live in the United States to set up an account.</p>
<h2>What type of sites can I host with DreamHost?</h2>
<p>You can use any DreamHost hosting plan for any type of use, commercial or private, non-profit or governmental. As long as all of your content is legal in the United States, DreamHost has no problem hosting your site.</p>
