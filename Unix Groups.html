<ul>
<li>You are expected to be knowledgeable in the UNIX shell.</li>
<li>Server changes performed by DreamHost may break your modifications. You, as the user, are responsible for troubleshooting and resolving issues with your customizations.</li>
<li>If you require root/sudo access to run a command, you must upgrade to a Dedicated server and add an <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215945467-How-do-I-add-users-to-a-Dedicated-server-">admin user</a>.</li>

<p>The primary use of Unix Groups is to assign “group ownership” of files and directories. You can configure this in the panel on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=users.groups&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix Groups</a> page. However, please note that only users with <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215282088">Enhanced User Security</a> disabled can have their user group changed.</p>

<li><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267">SSH</a> to the server as your 'webmaster' Shell user and then give the "contributor_group_test" access to whichever directory you want the user "contributor_unixgroup" to access.

<li>While still logged in as "webmaster", give the group (and all users in it) the desired level of access for that directory.

<li>Exit the session and then log back in as 'contributor_unixgroup'.</li>
<li>Make a symbolic link (i.e., a shortcut) to the directory with this command:

<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">ln -s /home/webmaster_unixgroup/example.com/contributor_dir /home/contributor_unixgroup/</span></pre>

<h2><span id="Caveats">Caveats</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ul>
<li>If you have any .cgi files, the above command makes them fail to run and generates HTTP 500 errors. Be sure that you leave the group for the .cgi and its parent directory as the default group. In other words, if your .cgi file is in <strong>/home/joe/example.com/cgi/fun.cgi</strong> then the following directories/files must be joe's default group:
<ul>
<li><strong>/home/joe/example.com/cgi</strong></li>
<li><strong>/home/joe/example.com/cgi/fun.cgi.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Some file servers have an internal limit of 16 groups. If you are in more than 16 groups, only the first 16 (as listed by the "groups" command) are considered.</li>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<ul>
<li>Every DreamHost shared hosting account has a Unix Group in the form of pg####### (where each # is a [0-9] digit):</li>
<li>This group is called "a default group" and there is exactly 1 per account.</li>
<li>Every Unix User and every Mailbox belonging to the account is a member of this group. Your files and folders are not shared outside of your account.</li>
<li>Each Unix User's default Unix Group is entirely determined by the Unix User's <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215282088-How-do-I-set-up-Enhanced-User-Security-">Enhanced User Security</a> check-box option.</li>

<h2><span id="Advanced:_Protecting_your_files_from_other_members_of_your_group">Advanced: Protecting your files from other members of your group</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The following sections are for advanced users with a solid knowledge of the Unix command-line.</p>
<h3><span id="Option_one:_chgrp">Option one: chgrp</span></h3>
<p>To keep other members of your group from accessing your files, you can create a new group in the panel and add <strong>only yourself</strong> to the group. Then, change the group of all of your files that you want to protect:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chgrp -R my_group /home/user/directory</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The down side to this is that you have to chgrp any new files when they are created in order to continue protecting them.</p>
<h3><span id="Option_two:_chmod_g-x">Option two: chmod g-x</span></h3>
<p>To keep everyone from your group out, you can also use this method. Simply remove execute permissions from the directory you want to protect:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chmod g-x /home/user/directory</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The down side to this is that you have to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>to do this for every folder that you create, and</li>
<li>not to do it to any of your web folders.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span id="Option_three:_SetGID_bit">Option three: SetGID bit</span></h3>
<p>Set the GID bit on your root folder and any already existing folders:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">chgrp -R &lt;my_group&gt; ~/
find ~/ -xdev -user &lt;username&gt; -group &lt;my_group&gt; -type d -print -exec chmod +s {} \;
</span></pre>
</div>
<p>Line #1 of this changes the group ownership of all 'files' and 'folders' (within your home folder ~/) to the specified &lt;my_group&gt;.</p>
<p>Line #2 'sets the GID bit' for all the 'folders' within your home folder and it's subfolders. In particular, it modifies all that are owned by the specified &lt;my_group&gt; which should be all of them if the command from line #1 was executed successfully. Setting the GID bit on a folder changes it such that subsequently any folders or files created within it will be owned by the specified &lt;my_group&gt;.</p>
<p>The down side to this is that if the group of a folder is ever changed, it loses the GID flag and anything under that folder is now created with your default (pg#######) group again.</p>
