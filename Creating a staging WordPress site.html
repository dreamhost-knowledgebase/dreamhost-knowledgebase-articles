<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>A staging website is a test site you can use to try out changes you'd like to see on your live website. For example, you could test&nbsp;new themes, plugins, and upgrades to see if anything negatively affects your site's functionality.&nbsp;This allows you to work on the staging site while not affecting the live website.</p>

</div>
<h2>Creating the staging WordPress site</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>These instructions assume you've either installed WordPress manually or by using the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215525277-Install-WordPress-using-the-DreamHost-WordPress-installer" target="_self" rel="undefined">DreamHost WordPress installer</a>. This also assumes that your WordPress site is on Shared, VPS, or Dedicated Hosting.</p>
<p>For the rest of this guide, it's assumed your website is <strong>example.com</strong> and the staging site is <strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>To stage a WordPress site, you'll need to manually create a duplicate of it. Follow the steps below in order to create a copy of your site.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002284771-Using-a-dreamhosters-com-subdomain">dreamhosters.com subdomain</a>. You can name it anything you like. This guide uses the name <strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong>. It may take a few hours for the DNS to update, but once it does, you should see a 'Coming Soon' page.</li>
<li>Copy the contents of <strong>example.com</strong> to <strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong>. You can use the following article to accomplish this:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214693138-How-to-move-WordPress-to-a-different-domain-at-DreamHost">How to move WordPress to a different domain at DreamHost</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you followed the steps in that article, your domain is not only copied to the new site, but the URLs in the database are also updated.</p>
<p>This is very important since every WordPress database has hardcoded URLs that need to match your website name.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>At this point, your <strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong> site should be an exact copy of <strong>example.com</strong>. You can now install and test anything you like.</li>
<li>When you've got your <strong>example.dreamhosters.com</strong> site set up exactly how you would like, it's time to move that data back to your live website at <strong>example.com</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Moving the staged site back to the live site</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>To move your staged site back to your live site, you can just repeat the step you previously took to copy the site:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The article above will show you how to import the data back into your live website and change the URLs in the database.</p>
<p>Once complete, your live website will be updated with the content from your staging site.</p>
