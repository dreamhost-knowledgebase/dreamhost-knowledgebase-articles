<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>It is sometimes necessary to update the version of PHP on your website. This is often due to a version no&nbsp;<a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">longer being supported by php.net</a>. Updating your website's software to be compatible with supported PHP versions is important to ensure your website remains stable and secure.</p>
<p>If you know your site is compatible with a newer version of PHP, you can change the PHP version for your site in your DreamHost panel using the instructions in the following article:</p>

<h3 id="h_01HC0RB11T0A5PVFE7GV52YTYM">PHP 8.x</h3>
<p>PHP 8.x is a major update from previous PHP versions. Code deprecated in older versions has been removed, so if your code has not been updated specifically for PHP 8.x, there is a greater chance that your site may not function properly when updated.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HC0RB11T17MNM42AHD8V6VNG">WordPress</h3>
<p>If you are using WordPress, DreamHost recommends updating <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037291651-Manually-updating-WordPress" target="_self">WordPress Core</a>, <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215527157-Managing-WordPress-themes" target="_self">themes</a>, and <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215300817-Managing-WordPress-plugins" target="_self">plugins</a> first before attempting to upgrade PHP.</p>
<p>See the following article to learn more about the minimum requirements for your WordPress site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress Requirements</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HC0RB11TT3N5EE6NKB7WHJ2B">Other CMS websites</h3>
<p>If you are using a different application to run your website, the <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/sections/203242327-Third-Party-Applications" target="_self">Third-Party Applications section</a> of DreamHost’s knowledge base lists several popular CMS options and updating instructions. Your application’s official website should list version compatibility information in its system requirements or support section. You can typically find the version you are using within the application’s administrative dashboard on your website.</p>
<p>The following links provide minimum requirements for a few popular CMSes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Updating_PHP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joomla! — Updating PHP</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Whatever CMS software you are using, DreamHost recommends that you first check to see that it supports the PHP version you wish to upgrade to and then upgrade your CMS software accordingly before updating PHP.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HC0RB11TWK82NWHCVZAK01ER">Custom site built by a developer</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The most common issue with custom sites is outdated code. For example, your site may be using deprecated functions that the newer version of PHP no longer supports. In this case, the site will continue to work, but you may see PHP warnings.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/214894197-Enable-PHP-error-logging" target="_self">Enable PHP error logging</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If the function has been removed from the newer versions of PHP, your site may not work properly. You can search for the function at <a href="https://www.php.net/">php.net</a>. Each function's page will confirm which versions of PHP still support it.</p>
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>If you are no longer able to reach your developer, DreamHost's <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/pro-services/management/site-update/php/" target="_self">Professional Services</a> may be able to assist you in updating your code.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HC0RB11T96GPH6KXQTJHHJF7">Can I continue to use an older PHP version?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Yes. If your site fails an automatic PHP upgrade, DreamHost applies PHP Extended Support, which will allow for the use of older versions and provide more time to correct any issues. View the following article for further details:</p>
