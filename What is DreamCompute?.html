<h3 id="h_01HPS9NJANZ81ATVZNBAY3CDF4">OpenStack</h3>
<p>DreamCompute is powered by OpenStack, a widely adopted, open-source cloud computing platform. It is used by both public cloud hosting companies, like DreamHost, and for private internal clouds.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HPS9NJANV79HAGB8TA9B54GB">Compute</h3>
<p>DreamCompute provides virtual servers through the use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page">KVM hypervisor</a>. Instances can be launched&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215912848-How-to-launch-an-instance-using-the-DreamCompute-dashboard">from the DreamCompute dashboard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216511617-How-to-launch-an-instance-using-the-OpenStack-CLI">using the OpenStack command-line interface</a>. Each instance is based on a Flavor. Flavors define the amount of resources allocated to the instance in terms of vCPUs, RAM memory, and boot volume size. DreamCompute provides Flavors small enough for companies just starting out, large enough for companies with greater computing needs, and everything in between.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HPS9NJANAZ85KYCH2Z6TPA6A">Network</h3>
<p>Networking services for DreamCompute are delivered through OpenStack’s <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron">Neutron service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HPS9NJANNCRZF66KJ9VNZB0E">Storage</h3>
<p>Storage in DreamCompute is implemented with <a class="reference external" href="https://ceph.io/en/">Ceph</a>. Ceph is a massively scalable, distributed, redundant storage technology that can be delivered using standard server hardware. OpenStack’s <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder">Cinder</a> project integrates with Ceph for block storage using Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) software.</p>
<p>Ceph is software created by DreamHost founder Sage Weil and has been under development inside DreamHost for several years. Ceph has been open source since its inception, and in early 2012, a new company called Inktank was spun out of DreamHost to support and continue development of the technology. Inktank was then acquired by Red Hat in April 2014.</p>
<p>Ceph is also the foundation for DreamHost’s cloud storage service <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/">DreamObjects</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HPS9NJAN9NA65597KQNSWQNE">Dashboard</h3>
<p>The DreamCompute dashboard is built with OpenStack’s <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Horizon">Horizon</a> project. The dashboard provides a user interface for interacting with DreamCompute’s three main services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions such as launching an instance, creating storage volumes, and configuring a virtual network, as well as creating and managing snapshots of both a running instance and storage volumes, can all be done in the dashboard (or using the OpenStack command-line interface).</p>
<h3 id="h_01HPS9NJANQ5XBQHEEBSVX28ZP">Automation APIs</h3>
<p>OpenStack, and therefore DreamCompute, has a whole host of APIs that can be used for system automation. More about OpenStack APIs can be found here:</p>
