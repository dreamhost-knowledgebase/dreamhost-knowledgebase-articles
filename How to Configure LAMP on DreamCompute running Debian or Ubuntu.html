<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>LAMP stands for 'Linux', 'Apache', 'MySQL', and 'PHP'. All of these components together make up the LAMP 'web stack' which is one of the most popular solutions to host websites.</p>
<p>This article explains how to install the LAMP stack on your DreamCompute instance.</p>
<div class="notebox-important">
<p>Due to the combined memory requirements of MySQL 8 and Ubuntu 20, DreamHost recommends that you do not install MySQL 8 on "semisonic" instances.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HQNWGW79TTXV80Q4N6XQVP2F">Setup methods</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two ways to set up a LAMP stack on your DreamCompute instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated</li>
<li>Manually</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just need to quickly configure LAMP to get something up and running, the automated solution should be fine.</p>
<p>However, if you're creating a long-term solution to host web content, you should install each component separately, as you'll have the most control over their installation.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQNWGW79R81YHTJ1218CJX5V">Automated (Ubuntu only)</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can use '<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/tasksel">tasksel</a>' to simply tell Ubuntu to install the “task” named lamp-server. This is accomplished with apt-get and using a caret (^) at the end of the task's name.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[user@instance]$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get update</span>
<span class="server">[user@instance]$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get install lamp-server^</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The second command is interactive, so you will be asked 'Do you want to continue?' in some places. Always type 'y' to continue.</p>
<p>You will also be asked to set a password for the root user of your MySQL installation. Create a secure password and save it, as you will need this later when you configure a database.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HQNWGW79WTRXXYGB17V8V3CY">Manual installation</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can also install Apache, MySQL, and PHP individually. The benefit of doing it this way is that you'll have a better understanding of what you're installing and how to configure your environment to suit your needs. View the following articles for instructions on manually installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP.</p>
<p>Make sure to always run an update before installing new software:</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[user@instance]$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get update</span></pre>
