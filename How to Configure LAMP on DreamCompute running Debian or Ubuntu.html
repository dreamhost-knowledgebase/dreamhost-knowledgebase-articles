<p>LAMP stands for 'Linux', 'Apache', 'MySQL', and 'PHP'. All of these components together make up the LAMP 'web stack' which is one of the most popular solutions to host websites.</p>
<p>This article explains how to install the LAMP stack on your DreamCompute instance.</p>
<div id="setup-methods">
<h2>Setup methods</h2>
<p>There are two ways set up a LAMP stack on your DreamCompute instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automated</li>
<li>Manually</li>
</ul>
<p>If you just need to quickly configure LAMP to get something up and running, the automated solution should be fine.</p>
<p>However, if you're creating a long term solution to host web content, it's recommended you install each component separately as you'll have the most control over their installation.</p>
<div id="automated-ubuntu-only">
<h2>Automated (Ubuntu only)</h2>
<p>You can use '<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/tasksel">tasksel</a>' to simply tell Ubuntu to install the “task” named lamp-server. This is accomplished with apt-get and making sure to use a caret (^) at the end of the name of the task.</p>
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox"><span class="server">[user@server]$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get update</span>
<span class="server">[user@server]$ </span><span class="command">sudo apt-get install lamp-server^</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The second command is interactive, so you will be asked 'Do you want to continue?' in some places. Always type 'y' to continue.</p>

</dl>
<p>You will also be asked to set a password for the root user of your MySQL installation. Create a secure password and save it as you will need this later when you configure a database.</p>
<div id="manual-installation">
<h2>Manual installation</h2>
<p>You can also install Apache, MySQL, and PHP individually. The benefit of doing it this way is that you'll have a better understanding of what you're installing and how to configure your environment to suit your needs. View the following articles for instructions on how to manually install Apache, MySQL, and PHP.</p>
<p>Make sure to always run an update before installing new software:</p>
