<p>The following is an overview of how auto-renew domains are charged, billed, and renewed at DreamHost.</p>
<h2>Difference between general domains and 'Auto-renew Only' domains</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>There are two types of domains.</p>
<ul>
<li>General domains</li>
<li>Auto-renew Only domains</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference is in the process of how and when they are renewed.</p>
<ul>
<li>General domains are renewed 31 days prior to the expiration date.</li>
<li>'Auto-Renew Only' domains are renewed on the expiration date.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overwhelming majority of domains are 'General' domains, but this article explains the process of how both are renewed. View the following article for further details on how auto-renew domains are charged and billed.</p>

<h2>What is the difference between the expiration and renewal date?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>First, it's important to understand the difference between the expiration date and renewal date of a domain:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/expiration_and_renewal_date.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3>Expiration date</h3>
<p>This is the date the domain name officially expires. For all domains, it is one day before a full calendar year from when you originally purchased the domain.</p>
<p>You can view this date by visiting the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registrations</a> page, or running a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215842648-How-to-run-a-WHOIS-query">WHOIS query</a>&nbsp;and looking for the 'Expiration date' line item.</p>
<h3>Renewal date</h3>
<p>This date is different depending on if your domain is a general domain (such as .com) or a specific 'Auto-Renew Only' domain (<a class="reference internal" href="#autorenew_only">see below</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General domains</strong> — The credit card is charged, the account billed, and domain is renewed 31 days prior to the expiration date.</li>
<li><strong>'Auto-Renew Only' domains</strong> — &nbsp;The credit card is charged and account is still billed 31 days prior to the expiration date, however the renewal date is different: the renewal date is the same as the expiration date.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What is the difference between ‘Charging the card’ and ‘Billing the account’?</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>The ‘Charge date’ is the date your credit card is charged for the domain renewal.</p>
<p>‘Bill account’ is the date your DreamHost panel posts the charge that is due. Billing the account only posts the information to your DreamHost panel—it does not actually attempt to charge the credit card at all.</p>
</div>
<h2>How to check if a domain is set to auto-renew</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<div class="notebox-note">
<p>New domain registrations and domains transferred to DreamHost are automatically defaulted to 'auto-renew'. You can adjust this setting by visiting your panel using the following instructions.</p>
</div>
<h3>Regular domains</h3>
<p>You can set a regular domain to auto-renew on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registrations</a> page. When you set it to auto-renew, the option is set to '<strong>YES</strong>'.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Renew_Date.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3>'Auto-Renew Only' domains</h3>
<p>The auto-renew setting is found on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registrations</a> page.</p>
<p>The "Auto-renew by" or "Delete by" deadline is listed on the <a class="panel-link" href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.registration&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registrations</a> page, directly beside the expiration date.</p>
<p>To renew an 'Auto-Renew Only' domain correctly, the domain's auto-renew setting must be enabled <strong>prior</strong> to the “Auto-renew by” or "Delete by" date found in the panel.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Auto-Renew_Only.png" alt="" /></dd>

<dd><em>When you hover over the tooltip, the following note box appears:</em></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><img class="img-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/Auto-Renew_Tooltip.png" alt="" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>If the domain is not auto-renewed on the expiration date as described below, it goes into a redemption period during which it can usually be recovered for an additional fee.</p>
