<li>Be sure that FastCGI is turned OFF.
<ul>
<li>Go to <a class=" " href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;" rel="nofollow">(Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains'</a>) in the panel.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button under Web Hosting next to the domain.</li>
<li>Locate "PHP mode" under web options check to see which version of PHP you're running.</li>
<li>If your PHP version is set to "FastCGI" then switch from PHP FastCGI to PHP CGI. For best results, stay within the same PHP 5.x.x version number.

<li>Download the migrator component to your system and then install it into the 1.0 install.
<ul>
<li>You can download the latest version of the migrator component (zip file) <a class=" " href="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/wiki_videos/JoomlaMigrator-1.5.zip" rel="nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
<li>This is done like any normal component install.</li>
<li>There is a migrator entry in the component menu option where you can access the migrator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install any third-party migrator plugins.
<ul>
<li>The migration system only handles the core system in its migration, which means that if you want to include any third-party extension data from other tables you must install migrator plugins to handle the migration of this data.</li>
<li>There are two types of plugins that are used: a "<strong>SQL</strong>" plugin which is a plain text SQL file, and an "<strong>ETL</strong>" plugin which is a bit of PHP that tells the migrator how to handle the data stored in tables (or in configuration files).</li>
<li>You do this by selecting "Add Third Party Migrators", and then locating the plugin you wish to install and uploading the file.</li>
<li>SQL files are automatically prepended to the output, and ETL plugins are automatically executed.</li>
<li>You can view a list of ETL plugins by clicking "List Plugins" in the main screen.</li>
<li>You can also upload ETL plugins to the "plugins" directory in the "/administrator/components/com_migrator" directory within your Joomla! site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generate SQL.
<ul>
<li>Once you have installed any third-party migrator plugins, you can select the "Create Migration SQL file" to begin the creation process.</li>
<li>The system is designed to build a SQL file without causing a timeout on the server, so you may notice that the page automatically refreshes and displays status information.</li>
<li>Eventually, it displays a notification that the process has completed and the SQL file is available for download.</li>
<li>Part of the SQL file generation involves the alteration of various fields to make them compatible with changes made in Joomla! 1.5, including the rewriting of mosimage tags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rename the Joomla! directory for your 1.0.x version by appending a "-1.0" to the end. For example, if it is named "EXAMPLE.COM" change the name to "EXAMPLE.COM-1.0"
<ul>
<li>After renaming EXAMPLE.COM to EXAMPLE.COM-1.0 it will no longer be accessible from the web.</li>
<li>This step is necessary because the DreamHost installer needs to have the app be in the original install location for the final upgrade to work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Install the new version of Joomla! 1.5.26 to EXAMPLE.COM, not EXAMPLE.COM-1.0.</li>
<li>Import the SQL file into Joomla! 1.5.26.</li>
<li>You have now upgraded to 1.5.26. To complete the upgrade to 2.5.6, see the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216141298-Upgrading-from-Joomla-versions-1-5-through-1-5-26-to-2-5-6">upgrade from versions 1.5 through 1.5.26 to Joomla! 2.5.6 section</a>.</li>
