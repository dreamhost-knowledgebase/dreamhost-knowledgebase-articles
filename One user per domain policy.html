<p>Each domain you host at DreamHost can only be owned by a single FTP/SFTP/SHELL user. This article explains how this is configured on the server and also how to switch a user to use a different domain.</p>
<h2><span id="How_users_and_domains_are_assigned_to_each_other">How users and domains are assigned to each other</span></h2>
<p>You can create a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214694298-What-are-the-different-types-of-DreamHost-users-">website user</a> in your panel and allow that single user to access multiple domains. The following image illustrates this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="1user 00.png" height="149" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/1user_00.png" width="606"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>This configuration is beneficial for resellers and web developers that manage multiple domains.</p>
<p>However, the opposite is not possible as you cannot assign multiple users to a single domain:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="1user 03.png" height="141" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/1user_03.png" width="605"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>When you create a second website user, that new user is only able to view their own home directory and the files/folders within it. They will not be able to access the website files under a different user.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="1user 01.png" height="319" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/1user_01.png" width="606"/></dd>
</dl>
<h2><span id="Changing_the_website_user_to_which_a_domain_is_assigned">Changing the website user to which a domain is assigned</span></h2>
<p>You can change the user a domain is assigned to at any time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the (<a href="https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=domain.manage&amp;">Panel &gt; 'Domains' &gt; 'Manage Domains’</a>) page.</li>
<li>Click the ‘Edit’ link to the right of the domain under the ‘Web Hosting’ column.</li>
<li>Scroll down in the page that follows and see the “Users, Files and Paths” section as shown in the following:
<dl>
<dd><img alt="" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/2018-06_panel_domains_username.png"/></dd>

</li>
<li value="4">Select another user from the dropdown menu.

<p>Migrating the data to the user takes more time depending on how much data the original user needs to copy to the new user.</p>
<p>If the new username is on a different server, the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> must <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> before the site resolves online to the new user and servername.</p>
</div>

<h2><span id="Verify_the_domain_is_resolving_from_the_new_username">Verify the domain is resolving from the new username</span></h2>
<p>Follow these steps to confirm the site is responding from the new username.</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the website.</li>
<li>Log into your server via <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000675027#FTP_security">SFTP</a> or <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/216041267-SSH-overview">SSH</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the /home/&lt;newuser&gt;/logs/&lt;domain&gt;/http/access.log.</li>
<li>Open this file and check for current entries.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="Remapping_a_subdirectory">Remapping a subdirectory</span></h2>
<p>DreamHost offers another solution to allow other users to access specific folders under another user. Visit the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217237707-Remapping-a-subdirectory-Remap-Sub-Dir-">Remap Sub-Dir</a> article for further details.</p>
<p>The setup for this is illustrated in the following image:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img alt="1user 02.png" height="304" src="https://objects-us-west-1.dream.io/kbimages/images/1user_02.png" width="605"/></dd>
</dl>
<p>This configuration takes the folder in the domain you specify and creates a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symlink</a>" to the home directory of the website user you specify. The only downside to this is that the website user will not be able to access the folder via FTP as it is in reality in the second user account’s home directory.</p>
<h2><span id="Naming_your_website_user">Naming your website user</span></h2>
<p>When creating a new website user that is used by multiple people, it’s recommended to give it a general name such as ‘Domain_Admin’.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Example</dt>
</dl>
<p>You wish to create a User for your companies website, and there will be multiple people using this FTP user login.</p>
<ul>
<li>You wouldn't want to name the User Account after you, such as <strong>Bob_Smith</strong></li>
<li>Instead, use a name that is more domain/company-centric, such as <strong>Domainname_Admin</strong></li>
</ul>
