<p>Each domain you host at DreamHost can only be owned by a single SFTP or SHELL user. This configuration helps to secure a domain as data from one user cannot access a domain under a different user.</p>
<p>This article explains this configuration and how to move a domain to a different user.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HA8CC200NBM91SKTPW9NHB2Q">User 1</h3>
<p>When creating a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214694298-What-are-the-different-types-of-DreamHost-users-">website user</a> in your panel, you are able to assign that single user access to multiple websites. For example, the following shows one user that has access to three websites.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/one-user-per-domain-1.svg" width="450" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="h_01HA8CC200BZ1YNP7BPT5F44QV">User 2</h3>
<p>When a second user is created, that user only has access to their own websites. The following shows a second user that has access to three different websites.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/one-user-per-domain-2.svg" width="450" /></dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="h_01HA8CC2008Q1SDWNZP4V6PAN3">Users do NOT have access to each other's data</h3>
<p>User 2 is only able to view <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001219231-Where-is-the-home-directory-#the-users-home-directory" target="_self">their own home directory</a> and the files/folders within it. They will not be able to access the website files under a different user.</p>
<p>In the following example, User 2 <strong>DOES NOT</strong> have access to <strong>ANY</strong> of the websites under User 1.</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class="gfx-border" src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/graphics/one-user-per-domain-3.svg" width="450" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>The same is true about User 1.</p>
