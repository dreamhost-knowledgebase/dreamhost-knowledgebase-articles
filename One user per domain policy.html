<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>Each domain you host at DreamHost can only be owned by a single FTP/SFTP/SHELL user. This article explains how this is configured on the server and also how to switch a user to use a different domain.</p>
</div>
<h2><span id="How_users_and_domains_are_assigned_to_each_other">How users and domains are assigned to each other</span></h2>
<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>You can create a <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/214694298-What-are-the-different-types-of-DreamHost-users-">website user</a> in your panel and allow that single user to access multiple domains. The following image illustrates this:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/1user_00.png" alt="1user 00.png" width="606" height="149" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>This configuration is beneficial for resellers and web developers that manage multiple domains.</p>
<p>However, the opposite is not possible as you cannot assign multiple users to a single domain:</p>
<dl>
<dd><img src="https://kbimages.dreamhosters.com/images/1user_03.png" alt="1user 03.png" width="605" height="141" /></dd>
</dl>
<p>When you create a second website user, that new user is only able to view their own home directory and the files/folders within it. They will not be able to access the website files under a different user.</p>

<p>Migrating the data to the user takes more time depending on how much data the original user needs to copy to the new user.</p>
<p>If the new username is on a different server, the <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215413857-DreamHost-DNS-overview">DNS</a> must <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/215840248-DNS-propagation-overview">propagate</a> before the site resolves online to the new user and servername.</p>

<div class="solvvy-solution">
<p>When creating a new website user that is used by multiple people, it’s recommended to give it a general name such as ‘Domain_Admin’.</p>

<dt>Example</dt>
</dl>
<p>You wish to create a User for your companies website, and there will be multiple people using this FTP user login.</p>
<ul>
<li>You wouldn't want to name the User Account after you, such as <strong>Bob_Smith</strong></li>
<li>Instead, use a name that is more domain/company-centric, such as <strong>Domainname_Admin</strong></li>
